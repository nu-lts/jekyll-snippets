Snell Library Friends (SLF), I hope you are all some place warm-- perhaps under a blanket with a good read or in sunny Mexico drinking a cerveza.  As for me I trekked home in the snow with my little black heels but luckily only fell down once, maybe twice.  Am happy to report am now in bed with fluffy white cat, laptop, and a Sam Adams cherry wheat beer (an offering from my roommate-- don't want you to think that I would buy the stuff on my own-- negro modela or an IPA for me thank you very much).  So, wherever you are during this blizzard and over the holiday break, if you are looking for a good read I recommend [_Catfish and Mandala_ ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~/a?searchtype=t&searcharg=catfish+and+mandala&searchscope=13&SORT=D&SUBMIT=Search)or [_The Last of Her Kind_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search/?searchtype=t&searcharg=last+of+her+kind&searchscope=13&sortdropdown=-&SORT=D&extended=1&SUBMIT=Search&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=tcatfish+and+mandala).  _Catfish_ is about a personal journey back to Vietnam as an adult after the author departed on a boat when he was 10 years old.  _Last of Her Kind_ is a novel that follows the friendship and heartache that occurs between two women as they experience the late sixties and beyond.

What are your recommended reads for a wintry day?
