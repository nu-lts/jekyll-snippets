<p class="MsoNormal">At this time of year, the holiday spirit can be infectious.<span>  </span>And if, like me, you thoroughly enjoy that spirit and are a book-lover, give in to temptation and immerse yourself in it with a few choice holiday reads.<span>  </span>There are rightfully beloved classics such <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/tchristmas+carol/tchristmas+carol/1%2C10%2C18%2CE/2exact&amp;FF=tchristmas+carol&amp;1%2C6%2C/indexsort=-" title="A Christmas Carol"><em>A Christmas Carol </em></a>by Charles Dickens, or Dr. Seuss’s <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search/?searchtype=t&amp;searcharg=how+the+grinch+stole+christmas&amp;searchscope=13&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=D&amp;extended=1&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=tchristmas+carol" title="How the Grinch Stole Christmas"><em>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</em>.<span>  </span></a>But there are also a host of others that touch briefly or indirectly on the topic and still seem imbued with that festive spirit.<span>  </span>L.M. Montgomery is one of my favorite authors to suit that purpose and her <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/tanne+of+windy+poplars/tanne+of+windy+poplars/1%2C1%2C2%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=tanne+of+windy+poplars&amp;2%2C%2C2/indexsort=-" title="Anne of Windy Poplars" target="_blank"><em>Anne of Windy Poplars</em></a> fits the bill nicely.<span>  </span>Anne invites her curmudgeonly fellow teacher, Katherine Brooke, home to Avonlea for Christmas and the season and Green Gables conspire to work their transformative magic on Katherine.<span>  </span>Even though it’s a familiar outline, it still always makes me wish I too, were spending the holidays on <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Prince Edward Island</st1:place></st1:state>!</p>

Do you have any favorites? Plus, any grinches out there who have their own alternative or anti-holiday picks?
