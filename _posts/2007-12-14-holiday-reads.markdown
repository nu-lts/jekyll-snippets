At this time of year, the holiday spirit can be infectious.  And if, like me, you thoroughly enjoy that spirit and are a book-lover, give in to temptation and immerse yourself in it with a few choice holiday reads.  There are rightfully beloved classics such [_A Christmas Carol _](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/tchristmas+carol/tchristmas+carol/1%2C10%2C18%2CE/2exact&FF=tchristmas+carol&1%2C6%2C/indexsort=-)by Charles Dickens, or Dr. Seuss’s [_How the Grinch Stole Christmas_.  ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search/?searchtype=t&searcharg=how+the+grinch+stole+christmas&searchscope=13&sortdropdown=-&SORT=D&extended=1&SUBMIT=Search&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=tchristmas+carol)But there are also a host of others that touch briefly or indirectly on the topic and still seem imbued with that festive spirit.  L.M. Montgomery is one of my favorite authors to suit that purpose and her [_Anne of Windy Poplars_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/tanne+of+windy+poplars/tanne+of+windy+poplars/1%2C1%2C2%2CE/frameset&FF=tanne+of+windy+poplars&2%2C%2C2/indexsort=-) fits the bill nicely.  Anne invites her curmudgeonly fellow teacher, Katherine Brooke, home to Avonlea for Christmas and the season and Green Gables conspire to work their transformative magic on Katherine.  Even though it’s a familiar outline, it still always makes me wish I too, were spending the holidays on Prince Edward Island!





 
Do you have any favorites? Plus, any grinches out there who have their own alternative or anti-holiday picks?
