<p class="MsoNormal">The earliest silent films often used books as their source material, from F.W. Murnau’s <em>Nosferatu</em> based on Bram Stoker’s <em>Dracula</em>, to D.W. Griffith’s <em>Birth of a Nation </em>taken from Thomas Dixon’s <em>The Clansman</em>.<span>  </span>Gearing up for Oscar season, late fall and winter releases seem to regularly adapt popular or acclaimed literature.<span>  </span><em>Beowulf, The Kite Runner, I Am Legend, Love in the Time of Cholera, Atonement, The Golden Compass, No Country for Old Men, Persepolis,</em> and <em>P.S. I Love You</em> are all adapted from novels or short stories.<span>  </span>Of those, I’ve only seen <em>Atonement </em>so far.<span>  </span>I enjoyed it and would recommend it, but I certainly didn’t think it measured up to Ian McEwan’s novel (which I loved).<span>  </span>But at the same time, if I love a story enough, I’m happy to see it in almost any version.</p>

What adaptations are you most eager to see this winter?<span>  </span>Which book do you think would make a great movie? (Who would you cast?)<span>  </span>And are there any movies which you think have blasphemed the books they were based on?
