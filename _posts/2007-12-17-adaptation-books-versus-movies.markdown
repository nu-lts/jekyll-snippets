The earliest silent films often used books as their source material, from F.W. Murnau’s _Nosferatu_ based on Bram Stoker’s _Dracula_, to D.W. Griffith’s _Birth of a Nation _taken from Thomas Dixon’s _The Clansman_.  Gearing up for Oscar season, late fall and winter releases seem to regularly adapt popular or acclaimed literature.  _Beowulf, The Kite Runner, I Am Legend, Love in the Time of Cholera, Atonement, The Golden Compass, No Country for Old Men, Persepolis,_ and _P.S. I Love You_ are all adapted from novels or short stories.  Of those, I’ve only seen _Atonement _so far.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it, but I certainly didn’t think it measured up to Ian McEwan’s novel (which I loved).  But at the same time, if I love a story enough, I’m happy to see it in almost any version.






What adaptations are you most eager to see this winter?  Which book do you think would make a great movie? (Who would you cast?)  And are there any movies which you think have blasphemed the books they were based on?
