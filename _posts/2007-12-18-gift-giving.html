<p class="MsoNormal">I love to read, and make sure to do it on a regular basis, and one stumbling block I occasionally run into is that I imagine all of my friends and family are as excited about it as I am.<span>  </span>When it’s time to give a gift, the bookstore lures me in, and I always think that the perfect gift will be a special book that I enjoyed and want to pass along to someone I love.<span>  </span>However, experience has taught me that after a point, a gift-recipient will say “Enough! They look good, but I’m never going to finish all of these.”<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p>I try and pick out something that I found interesting and enjoyable, but different enough so I’m not just thrusting my specific taste onto someone.<span>  </span><span> </span>Some of my most successful selections have been <em>Fasting, Feasting </em>by Anita Desai, <em>The Passion </em>by Jeannette Winterson, and <em>If on a winter’s night a traveler</em> by Italo Calvino.<span>  </span>I’ve learned that shorter works best!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p>Are there any books that you think make particularly good gifts?</p>
