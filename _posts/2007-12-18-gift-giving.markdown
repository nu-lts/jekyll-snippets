I love to read, and make sure to do it on a regular basis, and one stumbling block I occasionally run into is that I imagine all of my friends and family are as excited about it as I am.  When it’s time to give a gift, the bookstore lures me in, and I always think that the perfect gift will be a special book that I enjoyed and want to pass along to someone I love.  However, experience has taught me that after a point, a gift-recipient will say “Enough! They look good, but I’m never going to finish all of these.”  




I try and pick out something that I found interesting and enjoyable, but different enough so I’m not just thrusting my specific taste onto someone.   Some of my most successful selections have been _Fasting, Feasting _by Anita Desai, _The Passion _by Jeannette Winterson, and _If on a winter’s night a traveler_ by Italo Calvino.  I’ve learned that shorter works best!




Are there any books that you think make particularly good gifts?
