<p class="MsoNormal">Our video upload attempts got me thinking about video on the web. <span> </span>With the writerâ€™s strike stalling new television shows, I recently read an article on shows designed with internet viewing in mind.<span>  </span>It also seems that users (myself included) have come to expect a smorgasbord of free entertainment (including television) on the web.<span>  </span>While most networks have jumped on the bandwagon, usually providing a few episodes of their most popular programs online, they hardly offer an exhaustive season catalogue. This past week, I spent a fruitless hour trying to find episodes that I had missed.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Until I purchase a TiVo or DVR, is this a hopeless exercise?<span>  </span>Or is the possibility of a complete television canon, free and readily accessible online, in the near future?<span>  </span>Or, have users come to demand far too much in the way of free content, and will they be forced to pay for it, one way or another?</p>
