Our video upload attempts got me thinking about video on the web.  With the writerâ€™s strike stalling new television shows, I recently read an article on shows designed with internet viewing in mind.  It also seems that users (myself included) have come to expect a smorgasbord of free entertainment (including television) on the web.  While most networks have jumped on the bandwagon, usually providing a few episodes of their most popular programs online, they hardly offer an exhaustive season catalogue. This past week, I spent a fruitless hour trying to find episodes that I had missed.  







Until I purchase a TiVo or DVR, is this a hopeless exercise?  Or is the possibility of a complete television canon, free and readily accessible online, in the near future?  Or, have users come to demand far too much in the way of free content, and will they be forced to pay for it, one way or another?
