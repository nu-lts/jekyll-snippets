<p class="MsoNormal">This extremely snowy day has me thinking about the weather.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Where’s your favorite place to be when it snows? How does <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Boston</st1:place></st1:city> rank?<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I actually quite like both my apartment and so far, Snell Library, to be able to look out and see the snow coming down.<span>  </span>But I’m also someone who (as long as it’s not too cold) likes to be outside in the snow—skiing, either downhill or cross-country.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do you know of anyplace that’s particularly transformed when it snows?<span>  </span>Where do you like to be?<span>  </span>Or when it snows, would you prefer to be somewhere far away?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
