This extremely snowy day has me thinking about the weather.




Where’s your favorite place to be when it snows? How does Boston rank?  




I actually quite like both my apartment and so far, Snell Library, to be able to look out and see the snow coming down.  But I’m also someone who (as long as it’s not too cold) likes to be outside in the snow—skiing, either downhill or cross-country.  







Do you know of anyplace that’s particularly transformed when it snows?  Where do you like to be?  Or when it snows, would you prefer to be somewhere far away?
