<p class="MsoNormal">If you’ve ever ventured into a public library, you’ve probably noticed celebrity READ posters.<span>  </span>I’m always intrigued by the stars chosen, and their favorite books.<span>  </span>Some seem obvious, such as Orlando Bloom with <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.<span>  </span>Some seem more surprising, like Shaquille O’Neal with <em>Undying Glory</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How do you think the poster subjects are chosen?<span>  </span>Do you have a favorite literate celeb you’d love to seem emblazoned on your library’s wall?</p>
