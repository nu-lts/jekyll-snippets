If you’ve ever ventured into a public library, you’ve probably noticed celebrity READ posters.  I’m always intrigued by the stars chosen, and their favorite books.  Some seem obvious, such as Orlando Bloom with _The Lord of the Rings_.  Some seem more surprising, like Shaquille O’Neal with _Undying Glory_.




How do you think the poster subjects are chosen?  Do you have a favorite literate celeb you’d love to seem emblazoned on your library’s wall?
