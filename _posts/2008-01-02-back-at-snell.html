After a week in (not so) sunny California with my family, I'm back here in snowy Boston and in Snell Library. The break was good. It was nice to be able to walk outside without a coat on. It's good to be back here though too. Next week the semester will start and things will get crazy but for now it's still quiet. (I'm currently typing this at the Circulation Desk because there are no patrons to help.) Soon we'll all be running around like headless chickens but for now I can enjoy the peace and quiet.
