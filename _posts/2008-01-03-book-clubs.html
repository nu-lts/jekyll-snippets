<p class="MsoNormal">Even though I really love to read, I’ve never been part of a sustained, organized book club.<span>  </span>One of my favorite elements of college was the discussion sections for my English classes.<span>  </span>I enjoy thinking about aspects of a text, analyzing them, and also getting to hear what others thought.<span>  </span>Of my friends who’ve been part of book clubs, the general consensus seems to be, that after the first meeting or so, no one usually ends up reading the book, and the get-togethers become more haphazard and purely social affairs (which can also be fun, but deviate from the original goal.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I’ve thought about trying to start a book club at the library.<span>  </span>Do you think that students would want to participate, or are they too entrenched in their own studies, to want to pick up additional reading?<span>  </span>Do you think library staff, or other faculty and staff from the Northeastern community would be interested?<span>  </span>And how narrow of a book club topic yields the best inquiry?</p>
