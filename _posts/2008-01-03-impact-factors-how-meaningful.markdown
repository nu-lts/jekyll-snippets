Our engineering librarian, Joan Omoruyi, has recently called our attention to an article published in Journal of Cell Biology, which calls into question the methodology used in determining journal impact factors.  The article is here:

The NU Libraries recently acquired access to Journal Citation Reports, which includes journal impact factors.
