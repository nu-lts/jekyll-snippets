This recent [New Yorker article](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/11/05/071105fa_fact_grafton?printable=true) gives a lovely overview of the progress we've made, as humans, in digitizing our intellectual output.  You may notice that the article's author, Anthony Grafton, is a clear library supporter, as all good and right-thinking people are.  However, even if libraries aren't your cup of tea, Mr. Grafton makes clear the sheer scale of effort that truly "putting it all up on the Web" entails.  As any of our researchers in pre-1900 areas know ([Poole's Index](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/record=b1439370a), anyone?) the **bulk** of our intellectual heritage is **not** digitized.  Who's going to digitize it?  And who's going to organize the resulting mass of stuff so it's usable?
