Writing an e-mail or a letter is one thing but posting something to a blog is totally different. E-mails can be rambling and just thoughts and also don't need to have spelling corrected, Spell Checker where are you?  Blogs on the other hand...wow for someone heading from middle age to old age I am just farklempt ( a jewish word I just love ) and also one could say fartoost. I have just been shown a wonderful Yiddish website so will now be using some of the wonderful words I have found on it. But it is all fun and I am hoping that it won't take me too long to learn all the ins and outs of blogging.
