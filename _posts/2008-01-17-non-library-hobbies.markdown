[This is mainly just a test post using my individual login...] Most of us affiliated with libraries would list "reading" as a primary hobby, but I'm curious what else people are involved in, what non-library activities we enjoy. I play clarinet in a community band, for instance, and I also just got an acoustic guitar for Christmas and can't WAIT to learn to play. (Anyone want to offer me free instruction? I'll trade proofreading/copyediting services for guitar lessons... :) )
