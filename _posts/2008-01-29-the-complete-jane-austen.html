<p class="MsoNormal">I heartily enjoy Jane Austen’s six novels (though I find <em>Persuasion</em> divine, and <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> merely good) and I also usually enjoy the manifold film and television representations of her stories.<span>  </span>So I was quite excited for PBS’s new <em>Masterpiece Theater </em>season opening with <em>The Complete Jane Austen</em>—broadcasting adaptations of her six novels, along with a Jane Austen biopic.<span>  </span>So far new ITV (a British channel) productions of <em>Persuasion, Northanger Abbey, </em>and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on"><em>Mansfield</em></st1:placename><em> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Park</st1:placetype></em></st1:place> have aired.<span>  </span>I’m not quite sure what to think.<span>  </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If I love a book, I usually enjoy seeing an adaptation, even if I think it fails to fully capture the <a href="http://http://neutrino.neu.edu/library/blog/blog2/index.php?p=14" title="adaptation">original</a>.  And one thing that I am frustrated by is how other ‘fans’ can often become a critical mob, eager to find faults, and unwilling to appreciate the unexpected or something that deviates slightly from their own vision.<span>   </span>With these recent Austen adaptations I am a bit perplexed.<span>  </span>I’ve read that they’ve trimmed down these versions to fit into a 90 minute running time.<span>  </span>I know all the stories well, but I feel like if I didn’t I’d be quite confused.<span>  </span>These seem less like complete stories than illustrated Cliffsnotes. <span> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">However, I don’t want to become too wacky of a fan.<span>  </span>I studied English in college, and the late 18<sup>th</sup> century/early 19<sup>th</sup> century in particular, so I always felt a bit self-conscious about the zaniness of Austen-maniacs.<span>  </span>In addition to film and television, there’s a whole cottage industry of spin-off books.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">What do you think about Austen adaptations?<span>  </span>How about the PBS series?<span>  </span>And do you ever feel chagrin when you see your fellow fans (whatever your topic of interest might be)?</p>
