<p class="MsoNormal">Seeing as I wrote about Jane Austen yesterday, I wanted to continue in that vein and write a bit more about an Austen spin-off I recently enjoyed.<span>  </span><em>The Jane Austen Book Club</em> by Karen Joy Fowler was published in 2004, but I did not read it until this past summer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This was a book I had been somewhat interested in, but never felt fully motivated to pick up.<span>  </span>Last summer I finally checked it out of the library, and read it while traveling to visit a friend.<span>  </span>I became instantly absorbed, and found the novel both humorous and moving.<span>  </span>I thought Fowler created a novel that was both innovative and entertaining, and which borrowed from Jane Austen, while still remaining subtle and original.<span>  </span>I felt like she was really able to capture Austen’s style and wit, while using her own voice to create fresh stories and characters.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The novel follows the formation of a book club in the <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sacramento</st1:place></st1:city> area—a group comprised of six members who plan to read and discuss Austen’s six novels.<span>  </span>The group is made up of five women, and one man, and an adventure of love and self-discovery results for each member of the group.<span>  </span>While each section begins as they meet for book club, I found the character “flashbacks” the most interesting and poignant parts of the novel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I found <em>The Jane Austen Book Club </em>to be one of those novels that’s just a real pleasure to read, and I’d thoroughly recommend it.<span>  </span>(Though, as a houseguest, I did wander off a bit in my eagerness to keep reading!)</p>
