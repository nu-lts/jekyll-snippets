There's been some good "viral marketing" going on on campus already, but I thought it was also worth mentioning here -- the NU Libraries now offer Web of Science! We're super-excited to finally have this powerful resource available. For those who may not be familiar with this database, it's actually a suite of citation indexes from ISI Web of Knowledge. It includes Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, and Arts & Humanities Citation Index -- so it's not just science, despite the name.

The main reason it's so great is how easy it makes citation searching. Say you've found a good article from 1994 and you want to see how many articles after that date list the first article as a reference. Web of Science makes this extremely easy. Just enter the info about the 1994 article -- usually author's name and the journal title will be sufficient -- and voila, you'll get a list of subsequent articles that cite it. Then you can see what publications cite _those_ articles, and so on, tracking a trail of citations up to the present day.

Why is this useful? Well, generally speaking, the more a source is cited, the more important it is within its field. Maybe it's important because it first introduced some major new discovery, or maybe it's important because it makes a controversial claim that many other people want to debate. Either way, citation searching allows you to quickly see who the major players are in a given field, and how the dialog is continuing. It can be more targeted than regular keyword searching, too, since you can use the citation trail to follow the discussion of a particular topic.

I urge all you researchers out there to head on over to the [Library website](http://www.lib.neu.edu) and check out this terrific resource. Enjoy, and let us know what you think, or what tips you have for using it!
