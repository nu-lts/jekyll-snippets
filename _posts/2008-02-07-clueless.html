<p class="MsoNormal">I vividly remember when the movie <em>Clueless </em>came out.<span>  </span>I was 11, and had recently moved to a new town, and was going to summer camp with most of the other girls in town.<span>  </span>One early social outing was for a big group of us to go see <em>Clueless</em>, a film that had certainly been well marketed as “super-cool” for the pre-teen set.<span>  </span>I was very excited to be included, and it was the first time I went to the movies with friends, and without adults.<span>  </span>The movie lived up to everyone’s expectations of humor and glamour.<span>  </span>The following year I was able to cajole two friends into seeing <em>Emma</em> with me, and I at least, enjoyed seeing the parallels between the two movies.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fast-forward a few years, to when I finally <strong>read </strong><em>Emma</em>, and it becomes my favorite novel.<span>  </span>I was then also able to better understand the nuances of two of my favorite movies.<span>  </span>When I got to college and was studying Austen, one surprise was that while most of my professors and teaching fellows decried Austen movie adaptations, they universally admired <em>Clueless</em>.<span>  </span>For my 19<sup>th</sup> Century Novel class, our professor even sponsored a movie viewing after we read <em>Emma</em>.<span>  </span>One highlight was my TF extolling the virtues of getting to see the physical embodiment of Emma in Alicia Silverstone.<span>  </span>Seeing the film as I got older (and many times since) my appreciation for it has deepened.<span>  </span>In each new viewing, I uncover a new example of director Amy Heckerling’s trenchant wit and I marvel at how she was able to so supplely adapt the novel to a very different modern setting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>What do you think of <em>Clueless</em>?<span>  </span>How about all the Austen and other ‘trendy’ literary adaptations and updates that followed its success?<span>  </span>Do you have any favorite going-to-the-movies stories?</p>
