Has anyone had the opportunity to read the latest from Stephen King?  We got a copy from the public library and unfortunately only had 7 days so Joel tried and got bored after about 100 pages.  I actually made it past 100 pages and wanted to keep going but we were good library patrons and returned it on time.  OK so maybe it was a little late.  But I'd be interested to hear if anyone made it to the end and if it's worth getting back on the waiting list for it.
