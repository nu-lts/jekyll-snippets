<p class="MsoNormal">Keeping up with my Austen kick, another slightly chick lit adaptation that I read recently (this fall) was <em>The Family Fortune </em>by Laurie Horowitz.<span>  </span>This modernizing update of <em>Persuasion</em> was recommended to me by a friend.<span>  </span>Even though I’m well familiar with the story, I still found myself dying to get back to reading it.<span>  </span>Somehow, these stories still manage to generate in me a page-turning suspense.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>I thought certain aspects of this update worked better than others.<span>  </span>Jane Fortune, the Anne Eliot stand-in works for her family’s literary journal, the <em>Euphemia Review</em>.<span>  </span>While in keeping with Jane’s literary interests (and the opportunity for meeting her Captain Wentworth figure, writer Max Wellman), something about the unrealistic nature of her career bothered me.<span>  </span>The story is set in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Boston</st1:place></st1:city>, which makes it a fun read.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>While no Austen, and at times oddly irksome, I still found myself captivated by <em>The Family Fortune</em>.<span>  </span>What do you think of the cottage industry of chick lit ‘Austen’ retreads?<span>  </span>Do you have a book that fully captured your interest despite its faults?</p>
