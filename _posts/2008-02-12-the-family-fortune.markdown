Keeping up with my Austen kick, another slightly chick lit adaptation that I read recently (this fall) was _The Family Fortune _by Laurie Horowitz.  This modernizing update of _Persuasion_ was recommended to me by a friend.  Even though I’m well familiar with the story, I still found myself dying to get back to reading it.  Somehow, these stories still manage to generate in me a page-turning suspense.




I thought certain aspects of this update worked better than others.  Jane Fortune, the Anne Eliot stand-in works for her family’s literary journal, the _Euphemia Review_.  While in keeping with Jane’s literary interests (and the opportunity for meeting her Captain Wentworth figure, writer Max Wellman), something about the unrealistic nature of her career bothered me.  The story is set in Boston, which makes it a fun read.  




While no Austen, and at times oddly irksome, I still found myself captivated by _The Family Fortune_.  What do you think of the cottage industry of chick lit ‘Austen’ retreads?  Do you have a book that fully captured your interest despite its faults?
