I recently came across <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2184927/slideshow/2184934/" title="Library Architecture" target="_blank">this slide show</a> on <a href="http://www.slate.com/" title="Slate">Slate</a>, titled "How do you build a public library in the age of Google?"  It's an interesting tour of current library architecture, and the different ways cities are trying to adapt libraries into popular public spaces.

What do you think?  Do you have a favorite public library?  How does the building design play into your appreciation?  I know I prefer smaller libraries, and sometimes I find some modern architecture a little too sterile for my taste.  In any event, I still plan on checking out books for a long time to come!
