[Restaurant Week Boston](http://www.restaurantweekboston.com/) is a great way to break up the winter doldrums that hit once February passes and you realize that winter hasn't lost its hold just yet. This event gives you a chance to sample some of the area's finest restaurants (and not-so-finest) for the reasonable price of $33.08 (for dinner). The restaurants that participate offer a prix fixe menu Sunday - Friday for two weeks in March. You go in, ask for the RW menu, select an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert - most places have several choices for each course - then enjoy the meal and the company. True, sometimes the selections are a little weak (last year, nearly every restaurant had the same cheap cut of beef) or sometimes lacking in variety, but almost always excellently prepared or prepared in some unique way.

If you want to explore what that restaurant you've always heard about has to offer without spending a lot, dress up for a night out with friends, and forget that OMG, it's freezing outside, make your reservations without reservation. You'll have lots of fun.
