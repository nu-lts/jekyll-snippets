<a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/" title="Neil Gaiman">Neil Gaiman </a>has a series of <a href="http://journal.neilgaiman.com/search/label/free%20book" title="wonderful posts">wonderful posts </a>about reading, buying books, and free books. His publisher, by the way, is offering his book <a href="http://tiny.cc/WRiXE" title="American Gods"><em>American Gods</em> </a>online for free through March 28. Neil Gaiman talks the talk and walks the walk. He writes really well too - and now's your chance to read one of his more popular books for free if you aren't familiar with him.

When you're done with <em>American Gods</em>, don't forget that you can check out many of his <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~/a?searchtype=a&amp;searcharg=gaiman+neil&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=D" title="other works">other works </a>here at the Snell Library!
