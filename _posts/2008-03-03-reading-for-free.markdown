[Neil Gaiman ](http://www.neilgaiman.com/)has a series of [wonderful posts ](http://journal.neilgaiman.com/search/label/free%20book)about reading, buying books, and free books. His publisher, by the way, is offering his book [_American Gods_ ](http://tiny.cc/WRiXE)online for free through March 28. Neil Gaiman talks the talk and walks the walk. He writes really well too - and now's your chance to read one of his more popular books for free if you aren't familiar with him.

When you're done with _American Gods_, don't forget that you can check out many of his [other works ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~/a?searchtype=a&searcharg=gaiman+neil&searchscope=13&SORT=D)here at the Snell Library!
