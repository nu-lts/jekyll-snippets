"Scholarly communication" may not sound like all that exciting of a topic, but there's actually so many interesting ways in which it affects all of us in academia, whether we're students, faculty, or staff. A committee here at Snell Library has been working really hard to assemble a resource for the NU community on scholarly communication. This website provides news and information about topics related to this issue, such as academic publishing, copyright issues, and open access. Be sure to [check out this great new site](http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/scholarly/)  if you're interested in any of these areas!
