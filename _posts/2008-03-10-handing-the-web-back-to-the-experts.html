Here is an interesting <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/119091" title="go to Newsweek article" target="_blank"><em>Newsweek</em> article</a> suggesting that the Internet is beginning to move back away from the Web-2.0 phenomenon of user-generated content. (Just when some of us are getting excited about <em>adopting</em> Web 2.0 features!) The article explores the idea that Web users may now be more interested in seeking out expert opinions and reliable knowledge online. What do you think -- what is the place of user-generated content versus expert knowledge on the Web?
