One thing libraries take seriously is the privacy of their users. We go to great lengths to ensure that what you're reading is for your eyes only. That's why this article is so disturbing: <a href="http://www.eff.org/issues/printers">http://www.eff.org/issues/printers</a>. In an effort to stop counterfeiters, the Secret Service has persuaded some laser printer manufactures to encode printed pages with identifying information that could be used to track the printer and the person who used it. Sure, we can all agree that counterfeiting is a crime, and it certainly needs to be prosecuted, but isn't this going too far? What do you think? Should be libraries be doing something about this?
