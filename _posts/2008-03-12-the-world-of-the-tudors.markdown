Since I read _The Other Boleyn Girl _by Philippa Gregory, I was compelled to see how Hollywood translated her novel onto the big screen.  It certainly didn't disappoint me in terms of the visual feast of elaborate costumes, dangerous family rivalries, and sinister court intrigue!! Though all the fascinating elements were there that defined the Tudor reign, I still felt the movie fell short of the book.  As a fan of historical fiction, I love [Philippa Gregory](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/agregory%2C+phillipa/agregory+phillipa/-3%2C0%2C0%2CE/2exact&FF=agregory+philippa&1%2C7%2C/indexsort=-), author of _The Other Boleyn Girl_, who also wrote extensively on the Tudors in her other novels as well.  Her prose infuses the reader with the deep, rich textures of court life along with insightful character development.  So come to the library, and explore her wonderful works of fiction and dive into a fertile world of  imagination.
