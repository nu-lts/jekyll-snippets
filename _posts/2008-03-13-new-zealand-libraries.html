In honor of <a href="http://neutrino.neu.edu/library/blog/blog2/?author=17" title="Debbie Pennino" target="_blank">Debbie Pennino</a>, I thought I'd share a recent "library news" story that I came across: <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10497791" title="Auckland libraries on road to reciprocal free borrowing" target="_blank">http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10497791. </a> Around Auckland, library users have expressed a greater desire to access resources from other branches in their area.  (There's also a fun bonus map of New Zealand's regions!)
