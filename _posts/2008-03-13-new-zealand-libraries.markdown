In honor of [Debbie Pennino](http://neutrino.neu.edu/library/blog/blog2/?author=17), I thought I'd share a recent "library news" story that I came across: [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10497791. ](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10497791) Around Auckland, library users have expressed a greater desire to access resources from other branches in their area.  (There's also a fun bonus map of New Zealand's regions!)
