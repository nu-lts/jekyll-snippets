The attorney general for the US Federal Government has issued this order...

"The Department of Justice has called for these five public documents, two of which are texts of federal statutes, to be removed from depository libraries and destroyed, making their content available only to those with access to a law office or law library.

The topics addressed in the named documents include information on how citizens can retrieve items that may have been confiscated by the government during an investigation. The documents to be removed and destroyed include: Civil and Criminal Forfeiture Procedure; Select Criminal Forfeiture Forms; Select Federal Asset Forfeiture Statutes; Asset forfeiture and money laundering resource directory; and Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (CAFRA)."

See this <a href="http://scoop.agonist.org/story/2004/8/3/84635/46365">Link</a> for more details.  They have rescinded the order but the fact that the issued such an order in the first place is truly chilling.
