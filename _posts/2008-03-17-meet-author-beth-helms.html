Beth Helms is the next featured speaker in the Library's Meet the Author series.  She'll be discussing her novel <em>Dervishes</em> Tuesday, March 18 at 6 pm in the ISSI, 405 Ell Hall.  <em>Dervishes </em>explores the<em> </em>lives of the wife and daughter of an American diplomat living in Ankara, Turkey in 1975.  Helms, winner of the 2003 Iowa Short Fiction Award, draws on her childhood experiences living abroad in the Middle East to write this compelling story.  Turkish cuisine will be served at the event!  This talk and book-signing is sponsored by NU Libraries, the International Student and Scholar Institute (ISSI), and the NU Bookstore.  A campus map is available <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/campusmap/printable/campusmap.pdf" title="Campus Map" target="_blank">here</a>.  Ell Hall is building 52.
