In the April, 2008 issue of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com" title="TheAtlantic.com">The Atlantic Monthly</a>, the cover article is about the lives of paprazzi who follow Britney Spears in order to catalog almost every occurance in her increasingly chaotic life.  One might think that a reputable publication such as <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/Xthe+atlantic+monthly&amp;SORT=D/Xthe+atlantic+monthly&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=the%20atlantic%20monthly/1%2C40%2C40%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xthe+atlantic+monthly&amp;SORT=D&amp;3%2C3%2C" title="Find it at Snell Library">The Atlantic </a>having a story about Ms. Spears is a sign of a new low for the news media, I certainly did.  So I read the article, and wouldn't you know it, it really opened my eyes to something I didn't even realize I knew nothing about.  Paparazzi work really hard.  I mean it.  These guys are camped out all hours of the day and night hoping to get a shot that will make them a lot (and I mean a lot) of money.  In addition, the paps (as they are called), and the company they work for, sell these pictures to every news outlet in the world.   I'm not really going to get into it in this blog but I recommend that you read the article.  If you do read it please note the language is graphic at times.
