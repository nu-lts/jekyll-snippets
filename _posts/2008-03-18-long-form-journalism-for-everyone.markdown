Newspapers are dying. Century-old papers are shuttering their doors faster than anyone in the industry would have thought even 10 years ago. There are a variety of factors driving this, and no one can say for sure what they are.

But while daily news gathering takes a hit (worry not, it will return in a new incarnation), long form journalism, the type of story that can take months or years to research, is only gaining more and more ground. With this in mind, I've compiled a list of books that I feel exemplify this format of journalistic endeavor.

Danny's Picks:

[![FastFood](http://www.carsareevil.com/images/fast%20food%20nation.jpg)](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/cTX945.3+.S355+2001/ctx++945.3+s355+2001/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FF=ctx++945.3+s355+2001&1%2C1%2C) [Fast Food Nation,](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/cTX945.3+.S355+2001/ctx++945.3+s355+2001/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FF=ctx++945.3+s355+2001&1%2C1%2C) Eric Schlosser. One of the first books I read in this genre, Schlosser's classic looks at the food industry in America. Focusing on agriculture and the big businesses that thrive in this country, Fast Food Nation is a compelling read. From his ride-alongs with ranchers barely breaking even every year to his anecdote about the meat packer who fell into an industrial vat and died, Schlosser paints a horrifying picture about what we eat, and how it get to us.

Chico Mendes was an Brazilian intellectual, environmentalist, union leader, and in 1988, martyr for the rubber trade. After Mendes' death, Andrew Revkin immersed himself in Mendes' hometown, and researched a thick, but interesting read. With all of the historical background on the rubber trade as well as the cultures of the area, Revkin's book explains exactly what happened, why, and how it can be prevented in the future.

Classically trained in French Cooking, Bourdain worked his way up to the top of New York's culinary scene. At the height of food television's popularity, he published this voyueristic look at the food industry. From the fights to the romances to the vices of kitchen workers, Bourdain lays out exactly what happens behind the closed doors.
