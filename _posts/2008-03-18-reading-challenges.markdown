After taking a look at several reading related blogs, I’ve seen that many blogging readers participate in “reading challenges.”  The main prize seems to be the pride of checking a book off your list, and the joy of reading something new or different from your usual selection.  But I still might have more to learn about readerly ‘street cred.’  I’ve decided to undertake a few (when the blog goes live, I’ll sign up officially).  




One is [“TBR Challenge 2008”](http://tbrchallenge.blogspot.com/), in which you assemble a list of twelve books that have been on your “to be read” list and plan on finishing them over the course of the year.  Readers also select up to twelve ‘alternates,’ in case they decide that one of their first selections isn’t quite their cup of tea.  I’ve included my list, and throughout the year, as I complete books, I’ll be updating you on my progress.

(Some of these are books that I’ve received as gifts over the years, all are available through NUCat, and if they're checked out, try reserving through NExpress).  




Have any of you ever undertaken either organized or impulsive reading challenges? How did they go? And have you read any of the books? (Not too many spoilers, please!)
