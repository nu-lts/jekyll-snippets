The Future of food is a DVD that we have in the library's collection. It is a documentary about GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) crops such as Canola, Corn and Soy. This film gives the average viewer a basic understanding of how food crops are genetically modified and how GM crops may effect consumers. The primary focus is on plant agriculture in the United States.

I think the film maker would be a great guest speaker at one of your author talks.
