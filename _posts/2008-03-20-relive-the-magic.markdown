**Meet the Author programs **: If you want to see what you missed out on, or just relive the magic, go to the [library's flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/northeastern_university_libraries/).

Unfortunately, the photos cannot be organized into folders by event because that feature isn't available on the free account (the max number allowed is three). But I tagged every photo for easy searching.

Since I don't think this is linked to flickr, don't hesitate to add any of those photos to the gallery
