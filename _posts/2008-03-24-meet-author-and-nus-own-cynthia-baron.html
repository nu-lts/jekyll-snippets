<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial">In her new book, <em>Adobe Photoshop Forensics</em>, Cynthia Baron, Associate Director of Northeastern’s Digital Media and Multimedia Studies program, reveals an intriguing relationship between art and science as she describes how new technologies have assisted in the creation of altered images used for advertising, political propaganda, and even scientific fraud. In this work, Baron provides real historical examples and case studies of those who have used Photoshop to doctor photos for their own benefit and demonstrates the techniques used to deconstruct a photograph to detect fraud. This will be a fascinating discussion for anyone who enjoys shows like <em>CSI</em> or wants to learn more about advances in modern technology.<span style="color: red"> <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
