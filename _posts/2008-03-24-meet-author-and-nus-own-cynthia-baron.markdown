In her new book, _Adobe Photoshop Forensics_, Cynthia Baron, Associate Director of Northeastern’s Digital Media and Multimedia Studies program, reveals an intriguing relationship between art and science as she describes how new technologies have assisted in the creation of altered images used for advertising, political propaganda, and even scientific fraud. In this work, Baron provides real historical examples and case studies of those who have used Photoshop to doctor photos for their own benefit and demonstrates the techniques used to deconstruct a photograph to detect fraud. This will be a fascinating discussion for anyone who enjoys shows like _CSI_ or wants to learn more about advances in modern technology.




_HackerFactor.com’s Dr. Neal Krawetz calls Adobe Photoshop Forensics “excellent” and “a must-read.”_




**Meet Cynthia Baron on Wednesday, March 26 @ 4 pm. She'll discuss her book, sign copies and take questions in 90 Snell Library. Refreshments will be served!**
