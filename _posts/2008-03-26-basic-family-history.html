The first step in beginning research into family history is determining what do you want to learn about your family and the second step is determining what do you already know.

When you have decided what you do know about your family, write it down and there are free sources on the web for charts that can help with that. One of the sites is <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/trees/charts/ancchart.aspx">http://www.ancestry.com/trees/charts/ancchart.aspx</a>

Do not forget relatives, even the ones you do not care for as they can be a wealth of information. If you were told any stories while growing up about family members, check them out; they may have some truth to them.

Family tree magazine can also help. They have research guides by states: <a href="http://www.familytreemagazine.com/">http://www.familytreemagazine.com/</a>

Remember you do not know what you will find. So be prepared; once you find it then you will have to decide what to do with the information.
