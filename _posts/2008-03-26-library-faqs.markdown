Associate Dean Lesley Milner had a great idea to try and incorporate a list of Frequently Asked Questions into the "Library Suggestions" part of the blog.  Handling the suggestions, I'm familiar with some of them.  Often, the library is contacted by members of the public who are looking to see  if they might have access to the library.  (Which they are as long as they present a current photo ID and sign in at the library's security desk.  They are also required to abide by the Library's conduct policy and the University's computer use policy, available on the [library website](http://www.lib.neu.edu/libraries_and_collections/visiting_the_libraries/library_users/)).

Are there questions you frequently encounter that you'd like to see included?
