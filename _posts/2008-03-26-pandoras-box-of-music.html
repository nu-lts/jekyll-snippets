Do you ever get bored at work? (Note: if your boss is reading this, you should probably answer "No" to this question).  If so (or...not [see above]), then I have a great site, called <a href="http://www.pandora.com/" title="Pandora Radio">Pandora Radio</a> to share.  It's a "radio" where you can sort of make your own playlists!  You can just type in a favorite song or artist and the radio will play songs by that artist and other songs from similar sounding artists.  You do have to register for the site, but the best part is, they save your playlists (and you don't get annoying spam emails from them, either).  It's something fun to play around with, or just have in the background at your desk.  You don't even have to let anyone know what kind of music you're listening to, so go ahead- listen to your guilty pleasure songs and music genres!  In my case, this is country music (ok... I guess I lied when I said <a href="http://neutrino.neu.edu/library/blog/blog2/index.php?p=25" title="Gretchen Wilson">Gretchen Wilson</a> was the only country on my iPod.  Heh).
