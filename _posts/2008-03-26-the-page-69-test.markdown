The Page 69 Test is a fun and easy way to decide whether a novel is right for you. Simply open a book you think you might enjoy to page 69 and read that page. If you enjoy it, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the rest of the book. So the next time you're in a bookstore, or here in Snell, try out the Page 69 Test and see if it works for you.
