Until starting work at Northeastern, I was not aware of <a href="http://insidehighered.com/about_us" title="Inside Higher Ed" target="_blank">Inside Higher Ed</a>.  I've been very impressed with the content I've read thus far, and it's good to keep abreast of higher ed trends across the country.  I was also pleased to see that one of today's articles features the same title as Diann's blog post: <a href="http://insidehighered.com/news/2008/03/27/abroad" title="Sticker Shock and Study Abroad" target="_blank">Sticker Shock!</a>  However, this article deals with the lowering value of the US dollar, the increase in the cost of fuel, and the shaky future of the US economy in the face of a growing emphasis (including at Northeastern) on college study abroad programs.  Despite rising costs, there's still a huge push (and student interest) in programs abroad.  The article posits that the future for such programs may lie in cheaper foreign destinations, and that the ultimate effect on the future numbers who go abroad is still uncertain.
