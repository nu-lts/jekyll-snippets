The engineering library at Cornell University has updated their original Sticker Shock display. Visit <a href="http://astech.library.cornell.edu/ast/engr/about/StickerShock2.cfm" title="Sticker Shock 2">Sticker Shock 2</a> for a visual tour of price increases for a small selection of engineering journals.
