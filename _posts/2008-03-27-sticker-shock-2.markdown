The engineering library at Cornell University has updated their original Sticker Shock display. Visit [Sticker Shock 2](http://astech.library.cornell.edu/ast/engr/about/StickerShock2.cfm) for a visual tour of price increases for a small selection of engineering journals. It's a stunning display that emphasizes how much libraries spend to deliver quality information to its community of researchers.

Another sticker shock display that illustrates [rising journal costs](http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/scholarly/for_faculty/rising_journal_costs/) can be found through the Snell Library's [Scholarly Communication](http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/scholarly/) pages.
