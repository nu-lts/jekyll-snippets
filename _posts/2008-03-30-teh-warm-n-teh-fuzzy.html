Get daily warm fuzzies:

<a href="http://dailypuppy.com/" title="Daily Puppy">Daily Puppy</a>
<a href="http://www.dailykitten.com/" title="Daily Kitten">Daily Kitten</a>
<a href="http://www.dailybunny.com/" title="Daily Bunny">Daily Bunny</a>

I don't think these sites are affiliated with each other, but it hardly matters if you need some daily cuteness. For those of us who are allergic, or for whatever reason cannot care for a <a href="http://www.dailykitten.com/archives/782-keira-kibble-kiwi-and-kichiro.html" title="wee beasties">wee beastie</a> (or a <a href="http://dailypuppy.com/grownup/index.php?itemid=1743" title="great big beastie">big beastie</a>), these pictures of cute scoundrels are a window into warmth and fuzziness of pet ownership...without the vet bills and training time.
