Get daily warm fuzzies:

[Daily Puppy](http://dailypuppy.com/)
[Daily Kitten](http://www.dailykitten.com/)
[Daily Bunny](http://www.dailybunny.com/)

I don't think these sites are affiliated with each other, but it hardly matters if you need some daily cuteness. For those of us who are allergic, or for whatever reason cannot care for a [wee beastie](http://www.dailykitten.com/archives/782-keira-kibble-kiwi-and-kichiro.html) (or a [big beastie](http://dailypuppy.com/grownup/index.php?itemid=1743)), these pictures of cute scoundrels are a window into warmth and fuzziness of pet ownership...without the vet bills and training time.
