Trekking somewhere cool? Make it cooler by reading a book before you go or bring one for the ride.  Say you are going to Las Vegas — a truly vile place by all but [Roman ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/Xrome&SORT=D&m=x&b=sl/Xrome&SORT=D&m=x&b=sl&SUBKEY=rome/1%2C40%2C40%2CE/frameset&FF=Xrome&SORT=D&m=x&b=sl&26%2C26%2C)standards — what can be done with it? Check the Library and see what pops up…






	
  * If you’ve seen the movie, feel free to blow by _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: a Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream_ by [Hunter S. Thompson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzo_journalism) (PN4874.T444 A3 1998) but do check out some of his [other stuff](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search/?searchtype=a&searcharg=Thompson%2C+hunter&searchscope=13&SORT=DZ&extended=1&SUBMIT=Search&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=aHunter+S.+Thompson+): genius, as in does [Kerouac](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/ton+the+road/ton+the+road/1%2C33%2C46%2CE/frameset&FF=ton+the+road&12%2C%2C13/indexsort=-) better than Jack.



	
  * However, if you are into smart [emo](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/Xemo+&searchscope=13&SORT=DZ/Xemo+&searchscope=13&SORT=DZ&extended=1&SUBKEY=emo%20/1%2C11%2C11%2CE/frameset&FF=Xemo+&searchscope=13&SORT=DZ&4%2C4%2C) stuff at least scope out the contents, intro, and conclusion to _The Postmodern Urban Condition _by_ _Michael J. Dear (HT384.U52 L674 2000).



	
  * Social justice your thing? Try _Storming Caesars Palace: How Black Mothers Fought Their Own War on Poverty_ by Annelise Orleck (HV99.L37 O75 2005).



	
  * Suppose you are a compu-geek of some sort, why not check out _The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic_ by Richard A. Epstein (QA271 .E67 1995)?



	
  * If business is your business and thus personal, then Jeff Burbank’s _License to Steal: Nevada's Gaming Control System in the Megaresort Era_ (HV6721.L3 B87 2000) is the place to find insider nuggets.


Knowing a bit about where you find yourself makes for better tripping. Also, road trips are not about a change of scene, but a change of perspective which can begin before you sign on for a killer case of bucket seat [butt rot](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=butt+rot). In fact, you could save gas and fix up the ol’ perspective while right [here](http://www.lib.neu.edu/) or of course at the reference desk, [virtual](http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/ask_a_librarian/) or otherwise.
