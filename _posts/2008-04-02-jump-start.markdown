Have you ever been so enthralled by a book that when you finished it, everything else seemed to pale in comparison? I have.  For the past two or three months I have started a few books and not finished a single one.  Normally, I am not so fickle when it comes to reading but I simply cannot get excited about any of my selections.  In late January, I finished an incendiary piece by [Christopher Hitchens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_hitchens) in which he presents a [case against organized religion](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/Xgod+is+not+great&SORT=D/Xgod+is+not+great&SORT=D&SUBKEY=god%20is%20not%20great/1%2C113%2C113%2CE/frameset&FF=Xgod+is+not+great&SORT=D&1%2C1%2C).  If you have read any of Mr. Hitchens' work, you know that he might not always be right, but he sure brings his A game in a fight. (Hey, that rhymes!)  I tried to read a book by noted humorist [John Hodgman](http://www.amazon.com/Areas-My-Expertise-John-Hodgman/dp/B000O17CZ6/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207167408&sr=1-1), a piece of popular history about the [6 most historically signicant drinks ](http://www.amazon.com/History-World-6-Glasses/dp/B000O3S2F8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207167299&sr=1-1)(beer, wine, tea, coffee, liquor and soda).  I also cracked open some old favorites in hopes of sticking with a book, no luck.  Don't get me wrong, none of these books were bad, or poorly written, I just couldn't get interested in any of them.  I can't take this much more.
