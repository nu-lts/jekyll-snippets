<a title="http://www.storyofstuff.com/" href="http://www.storyofstuff.com/" target="_blank">This</a> is probably the most delightful video I've seen in at LEAST two days. It talks about the environmental and social impact that occurs at each stage of the production/consumption of goods. It's cute and funny and personable, but it also goes remarkably in-depth into the issue of, as Annie Leonard calls it, 'Stuff'. This little video covers where it (stuff) comes from, how it's processed, how it's consumed, and how it's discarded - things that are easily forgotten in that intial flush of excitement after purchasing a new little ipod or trinket. It makes me very guilty about my own obscene, unnecessary collection of random stuff. Just last night, for example, I bought seven sheets of handmade artisan wrapping papers from Papyrus. Why? No reason other than they were pretty (they really are so incredibly pretty) - and now they are sitting on my shelf as glaring, accusatory reminders of my own role as significant contributor to society's manic, superfluous consumption of 'stuff'. Sigh.
