I recently read a review of [Alberto Manguel's ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~/a?searchtype=a&searcharg=manguel%2C+a&searchscope=13&SORT=D&SUBMIT=Search)_The Library at Night_ in [the _LA Times_](http://www.latimes.com/features/books/la-et-book25mar25,0,197801.story).  It sounds like an interesting read-I've heard of his _With Borges_, but haven't yet read it.  While _The Library at Night_ sounds like a mix of memoir, general history and musings, the review got me thinking about the library as dramatic setting.  One of my favorites is the rather creepy and ambiguous tale, [_The Ghost Writer_ ](http://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Writer-John-Harwood/dp/0151010749)by John Harwood.  The scenes in the British Library stuck with me, and I wish I could visit it!  (In the book, the Library is still part of the British Museum).  When I finally visited the British Museum in 2005, I was disappointed.  While their reading room is nice, it's much smaller, and very different from the spooky Victorian locale detailed in _The Ghost Writer_.  I'll have to make a special visit to the British Library, the next time I'm in London.

Have any of you visited there?  And what are your favorite stories set in libraries?  What do you like about them?
