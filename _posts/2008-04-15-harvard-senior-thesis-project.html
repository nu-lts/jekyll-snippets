On the heels of the Harvard faculty mandate for open access to their scholarly work, Harvard students <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=522939">have created a website</a> for posting freely accessible copies of seniors' theses.  More specifically, this website was developed by the <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/freeculture/blog/">Harvard College Free Culture</a> group, a local chapter of <a href="http://freeculture.org/">Students for Free Culture</a>, a national organization inspired by, among other things, Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig's book <a href="http://free-culture.cc/">Free Culture</a>.
