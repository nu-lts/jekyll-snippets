On the heels of the Harvard faculty mandate for open access to their scholarly work, Harvard students [have created a website](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=522939) for posting freely accessible copies of seniors' theses.  More specifically, this website was developed by the [Harvard College Free Culture](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/freeculture/blog/) group, a local chapter of [Students for Free Culture](http://freeculture.org/), a national organization inspired by, among other things, Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig's book [Free Culture](http://free-culture.cc/).

For more background, see [this lively discussion](http://chronicle.com/news/article/?id=3943) of the Harvard faculty mandate on the Chronicle's news blog.
