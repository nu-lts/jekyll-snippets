This Thursday, Journalist Roy Harris will discuss his book <em>Pulitzer's Gold</em> as part of NU Library's Meet the Author series at 3:30 pm in 90 Snell Library.  Harris tackles the ninety-year history of the coveted Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.  The Joseph Pulitzer Gold medal is awarded annually to newspapers instead of individual reporters.  Behind each award-winning public story, there's usually an exciting private drama in the newsroom.  Some are well-known, such as the work of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein for <em>The Washington Post</em> uncovering the Watergate scandal.  Others, less well-known but often equally compelling, are skillfully recounted by Harris.  Each demonstrates the importance and consequence of public service reporting at papers, both large and small, across the United States. 

"This is the story of reporters who started out raking the muck and ended up mining for gold."-Anthony Marro, former editor of <em>Newsday</em>
