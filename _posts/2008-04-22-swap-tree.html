In honor of Earth Day, I wanted to post something I learned about recently that's meant to be environmentally conscious.  Yesterday, a friend told me about <a title="Swap Tree" href="http://www.swaptree.com/" target="_blank">SwapTree.com</a>, a site where you can exchange products you have (like books, cds, and dvds) for others that you want.  It's a massive trading website where you just have to pay shipping and handling costs.  While I'm a hoarder who likes holding on to things, I certainly appreciate SwapTree's message of re-usability and bartering!  My friend also told me that for every trade made today, SwapTree will donate $1 to the Sierra Club.  (Though I couldn't find anything corroborating that on their website.)

I also think that taste is such a funny and personal issue, that it would be interesting to see what people are looking for (or looking to unload.)  It seems like their could be some airing of dirty laundry-from my cursory survey it seems like people are looking to pick up much ‘hipper' items (and trade away <em>Chicken Soup for the Soul</em> and Kenny G!)

Has anyone tried this before?  What do you think?
