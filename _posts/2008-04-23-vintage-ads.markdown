I've been reading more about the history of graphic design lately. During the first part of the 20th century, the large portion of the client-base for graphic designers were cigarette companies. Looking back at ads from the 30s, 40s and 50s, I can appreciate the craft (they're all illustrated by hand), but it raises a lot of questions in my mind about ethics in a profession like graphic design. Like most, these designers did not know just how bad cigarettes were when these advertisements were composed. And this makes me wonder how many of the ads we see now will prove to be as ironic as these do now:



	
  * Like all the [good things](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aeillill/44223928/sizes/o/in/set-967623/) smoking can give you



	
  * And read the [reasons](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aeillill/44555215/sizes/o/in/set-967623/) why you should change to Philip Morris. They're recommended by nose and throat specialists!



	
  * Nevermind what they recommend. [What](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aeillill/44555082/sizes/o/in/set-967623/) do doctors smoke?



	
  * Where can I find [Tobaccoland?](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aeillill/44554983/sizes/o/in/set-967623/)



	
  * [ This](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aeillill/44564142/sizes/o/in/set-967623/) isn't intended to be marketed towards children. I know many adults who still play with their paper dolls.



	
  * [This](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aeillill/77055077/sizes/o/in/set-967623/) is just terrible.



	
  * And look, [a familiar face](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aeillill/77040058/sizes/o/in/set-967623/).
