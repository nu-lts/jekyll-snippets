With the new warm weather, and 70+ degree temperatures, I've been thinking about Summer Reading.  Though April's a little premature for summer, we're going to add a Summer Reading Category to Snell Snippets.  Bloggers can add their favorite summer reading picks.  (Or bemoan summer reading assignments-<em><a title="The Odyssey" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/todyssey/todyssey/1%2C61%2C159%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=todyssey&amp;43%2C%2C67" target="_blank">The Odyssey </a></em>is one that I'd put in that category!)

I like mysteries in general, and particularly classic, 19<sup>th</sup> century ones in the summer. In the past that's included books like <em><a title="The Woman in White" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/twoman+in+white/twoman+in+white/1%2C1%2C7%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=twoman+in+white&amp;4%2C%2C7/indexsort=-" target="_blank">The Woman in White</a></em>. This summer, I'm looking forward to reading <em><a title="Mysteries of Udolpho" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/tmysteries+of+udolpho/tmysteries+of+udolpho/1%2C3%2C3%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=tmysteries+of+udolpho+a+romance&amp;1%2C1%2C/indexsort=-" target="_blank">The Mysteries of Udolpho</a></em> and possibly <em><a title="Armadale" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/tarmadale/tarmadale/1%2C1%2C4%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=tarmadale&amp;1%2C%2C4/indexsort=-" target="_blank">Armadale</a></em>.  I also like the kind of beach reading that you can read in a day.  One of my best friends keeps up a steady diet of Trollope and Eliot throughout the summer, but I'm not that disciplined!  What are your favorite summer reads?

I also think that some authors and books lend themselves particularly well to summer.  F. Scott Fitzgerald springs to mind - I brought <em><a title="Tender is the Night" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/ttender+is+the+night/ttender+is+the+night/1%2C2%2C12%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=ttender+is+the+night&amp;6%2C%2C11/indexsort=-" target="_blank">Tender is the Night</a></em> with me to the French Riviera, but I don't think the synergy was quite what I hoped for.  I'd also be interested in starting a book club, if people were interested in reading any of the same books over the summer.
