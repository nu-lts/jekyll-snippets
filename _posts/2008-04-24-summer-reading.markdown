With the new warm weather, and 70+ degree temperatures, I've been thinking about Summer Reading.  Though April's a little premature for summer, we're going to add a Summer Reading Category to Snell Snippets.  Bloggers can add their favorite summer reading picks.  (Or bemoan summer reading assignments-_[The Odyssey ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/todyssey/todyssey/1%2C61%2C159%2CE/frameset&FF=todyssey&43%2C%2C67)_is one that I'd put in that category!)

I like mysteries in general, and particularly classic, 19th century ones in the summer. In the past that's included books like _[The Woman in White](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/twoman+in+white/twoman+in+white/1%2C1%2C7%2CE/frameset&FF=twoman+in+white&4%2C%2C7/indexsort=-)_. This summer, I'm looking forward to reading _[The Mysteries of Udolpho](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/tmysteries+of+udolpho/tmysteries+of+udolpho/1%2C3%2C3%2CE/frameset&FF=tmysteries+of+udolpho+a+romance&1%2C1%2C/indexsort=-)_ and possibly _[Armadale](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/tarmadale/tarmadale/1%2C1%2C4%2CE/frameset&FF=tarmadale&1%2C%2C4/indexsort=-)_.  I also like the kind of beach reading that you can read in a day.  One of my best friends keeps up a steady diet of Trollope and Eliot throughout the summer, but I'm not that disciplined!  What are your favorite summer reads?

I also think that some authors and books lend themselves particularly well to summer.  F. Scott Fitzgerald springs to mind - I brought _[Tender is the Night](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/ttender+is+the+night/ttender+is+the+night/1%2C2%2C12%2CE/frameset&FF=ttender+is+the+night&6%2C%2C11/indexsort=-)_ with me to the French Riviera, but I don't think the synergy was quite what I hoped for.  I'd also be interested in starting a book club, if people were interested in reading any of the same books over the summer.
