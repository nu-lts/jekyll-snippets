Recently, (over Easter) I saw the movie <a title="Stardust" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486655/#comment" target="_blank"><em>Stardust</em></a>.  I had seen advertisements and read reviews of it this past summer, and had wanted to see it then, but didn't end up having the chance to.  I saw it with my whole family, and everyone really loved it.

Diann had earlier written a <a title="Neil Gaiman" href="http://neutrino.neu.edu/library/blog/blog2/index.php?p=58" target="_blank">post</a> on Neil Gaiman, and he's the author of the comic the movie is based upon.  I've checked out the first volume of his Sandman series before, but couldn't really get into it.

I found <em>Stardust </em>to be a<em> </em>visually stunning movie, and to have a magical and sweet story at its core.  I think it's quite similar to <a title="Princess Bride" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search/?searchtype=t&amp;searcharg=princess+bride&amp;searchscope=13&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=1&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=Xprincess+bride%26SORT%3DD" target="_blank"><em>The Princess Bride</em></a>, but its humor is a bit more subtle. (Sorry Billy Crystal!)  <em>Stardust </em>follows young English lad Tristan Thorn, as he attempts to recover a fallen star; a journey that takes him from the 19<sup>th</sup> century village of Wall, into the supernatural kingdom of Stormhold.  That the star is not just a piece of molten rock, but a young woman is the first of many new discoveries for Tristan.  The movie seemed both humorous and generous, in a way that you rarely see.  As you can tell, I endorse it!

It also made me wonder-what are other good movies that you think may have fallen through the cracks?
