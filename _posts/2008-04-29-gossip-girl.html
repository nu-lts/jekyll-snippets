Last night, for the first time, I watched the show <em>Gossip Girl</em>.  My roommate is a fan, and so I finally watched it with her.  Despite having a quite a few friends who are fans, I've held off watching, even as the <a title="Best Show Ever" href="http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/46225/" target="_blank">hype has grown</a>. 

I remember reading about the (book) series several years ago and thinking it sounded <em><a title="Naomi Wolf article" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/books/review/12wolf.html?scp=2&amp;sq=gossip+girl+books+naomi+wolf&amp;st=nyt" target="_blank">horrible</a>.  </em>A series about debauched materialistic teenagers, without any moral characters-and it was a big hit? Yikes.  And so I internally groaned, when I read that it was being turned into a TV series.   

I think that plays, TV shows, films, etc., as they include human actors, humanize certain plot lines-these events "really" happen to an actual person.  I think this is why filmed or visually represented violence can be so much more disturbing (and lasting in memory) compared to something you read about.  I thought that <em>Gossip Girl </em>was alright, but I don't plan on becoming a regular viewer.

My favorite character is ‘evil' Chuck Bass, in part because of his clothes-extremely tight yellow jeans, a purple cardigan, with a teal and pink ascot; a bright red frock coat; an orange trench coat; in part because he seems so over the top, and because he's played by a <a title="Ed Westwick" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2067953/" target="_blank">Brit!</a>

Have any of you read the books or watched the TV show?  What do you think?
