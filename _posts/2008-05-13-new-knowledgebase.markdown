Campus Information Systems at NU has created a knowledgeBase of all kinds of technical support information.  It's going to be available to faculty, staff, and students through the myNEU portal.  It's developed from third party software called "Right Answers." The Knowledgebase has some canned information about the commercial software we have at NU, like Microsoft Office and Lotus Notes, plus some additional customized help that's been created by our local IS people, like how to change your myNEU password.  There isn't much there for the library yet, but we can send our own help, like how to log in to NuCat, Endnote stuff, and so on, and they will add it to the knowledgebase.  We can also supply them with links to our existing help, and then we don't have to update information in two places when it changes.  So if a user typed in "article alerts" they would either see some instructions or a link to our page where we have instructions already (or both).   IS is still tweaking it, look for an NU announcement when it's ready to roll out to the campus.
