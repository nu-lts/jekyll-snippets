You may know <a title="Julie Andrews" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000267/" target="_blank">Julie Andrews</a> as the star of <em>Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music </em>and <em>The Princess Diaries</em>, but I was quite excited to learn that she's also an enthusiastic supporter of public libraries! She wrote <a title="When you read" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-andrews15-2008may15,0,6092728.story" target="_blank">an editoria</a><a title="When you read" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-andrews15-2008may15,0,6092728.story" target="_blank">l</a> in yesterday's <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, criticizing budget cuts. I've visited some California public libraries (and in fact have a Palos Verdes Peninsula library card) but am not that familiar with LA libraries. Have any of you visited any? And what do you think of her editorial?
