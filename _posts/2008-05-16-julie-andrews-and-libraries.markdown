You may know [Julie Andrews](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000267/) as the star of _Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music _and _The Princess Diaries_, but I was quite excited to learn that she's also an enthusiastic supporter of public libraries! She wrote [an editoria](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-andrews15-2008may15,0,6092728.story)[l](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-andrews15-2008may15,0,6092728.story) in yesterday's _Los Angeles Times_, criticizing budget cuts. I've visited some California public libraries (and in fact have a Palos Verdes Peninsula library card) but am not that familiar with LA libraries. Have any of you visited any? And what do you think of her editorial?
