Please join us for Thursday's FOCUS (Forming Opportunities for Collaboration, Understanding, and Service) Forum-<em>From Homicide to Hope: A Community Approach to Reducing Youth Violence</em>.  <strong>Jack Levin</strong>, Professor and Co-Director of the Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict, student <strong>Alex Alvanos</strong> '09, Co-Founder of Social Change through Peace Games, and <strong>Emmanuel Tikili</strong>, Director of Programs for the Boston TenPoint coalition, will lead the discussion.  The program's goal is to inform the Northeastern community about issues that affect our neighboring Boston community and to provide the attendees with resources that empower them to serve the community and to act. Attendees will leave the program with more information on what exactly they can do to reduce youth violence.  This forum is sponsored by Northeastern University Libraries and the Northeastern University Center of Community Service.
