I am sorry to hear about Senator Ted Kennedy's ill health.  He's the subject of a [new online exhibit ](http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/Kennedy/index.htm)by the NU Libraries Archives on Student Financial Aid at Northeastern University.  The exhibit recounts Kennedy's strong support of federal financial aid for college students, and his relationship with Northeastern.  He spoke at student rallies, heard personal student testimonies, and held a press conference and a senate committee field hearing at Northeastern whenever student financial aid programs were threatened by presidential or congressional proposals.  The exhibit comprises photographs, articles from Northeastern University's student and faculty/staff newspapers, official statements, and background information.  I wish Senator Kennedy and his family the best.
