I have a few friends who use Bluetooth headsets, and one told me an upsetting story about her sister's friend, who was a day trader and constantly on her cell phone, and who developed a brain tumor, allegedly due to the radiation.  (According to her, the headset prevents this exposure).  While I still use my cell phone regularly (how can you not?), I do sometimes feel a little nervous about it.  Cell phones are so omnipresent-it's hard to imagine modern life without them.  I was quite worried when I read [this article ]( http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/warning-using-a-mobile-phone-while-pregnant-can-seriously-damage-your-baby-830352.html)on the dangers of mobile phones-particularly for pregnant women and children.  It left me wondering, are mobile phones [the cigarettes](http://nuweb7.neu.edu/library/snippets/index.php?s=cigarettes) of the future?
