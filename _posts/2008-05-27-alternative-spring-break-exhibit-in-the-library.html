Now through June 16, Northeastern University Libraries and the Northeastern Center of Community Service invite you to view <em>Break Out to Serve: Alternative Spring Break 2008, </em>in the exhibit showcase on the first floor of Snell Library.

During Alternative Spring Break 2008, 92 students<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>ten staff members from Northeastern volunteered their time to a variety of projects in a number of issue areas.

Volunteers dedicated a total of 4,080 hours of service, all providing unique experiences and assistance to communities in need.

In <strong>Fort Smith</strong><strong>, Arkansas</strong>, volunteers helped build four homes. Alternative Spring Breakers tutored children at an orphanage in <strong>Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic</strong>,<strong> </strong>in math and reading. Volunteers worked to repair and restore homes of senior citizens and people with disabilities living in <strong>Macon</strong><strong>, Georgia</strong>. Other students planted trees and worked to restore the environment on a wildlife preserve in <strong>Kissimmee</strong><strong>, Florida</strong>.<strong> </strong>Volunteers in <strong>Mobile</strong><strong>, Alabama</strong> assisted HIV/AIDS patients with daily living tasks, such as landscaping and housework. In both <strong>New Orleans</strong><strong>, Louisiana</strong> and<strong> Biloxi, Mississippi,</strong> students served by assisting in the continuing efforts to clean up post-Katrina wreckage. Students built a playground at a primary school and taught forty schoolchildren lessons for the week in <strong>St. Elizabeth</strong><strong>, Jamaica</strong>. In <strong>Tahlequah</strong><strong>, Oklahoma</strong>, volunteers helped lay PVC piping on the local waterline project as well as tending to other routine tasks within the Cherokee Nation. Volunteers worked at a camp in <strong>Killeen</strong><strong>, Texas</strong> for children with special needs and chronic illnesses.
