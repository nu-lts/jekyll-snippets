Now through June 16, Northeastern University Libraries and the Northeastern Center of Community Service invite you to view _Break Out to Serve: Alternative Spring Break 2008, _in the exhibit showcase on the first floor of Snell Library.

During Alternative Spring Break 2008, 92 students** **and** **ten staff members from Northeastern volunteered their time to a variety of projects in a number of issue areas.

Volunteers dedicated a total of 4,080 hours of service, all providing unique experiences and assistance to communities in need.

In **Fort Smith****, Arkansas**, volunteers helped build four homes. Alternative Spring Breakers tutored children at an orphanage in **Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic**,** **in math and reading. Volunteers worked to repair and restore homes of senior citizens and people with disabilities living in **Macon****, Georgia**. Other students planted trees and worked to restore the environment on a wildlife preserve in **Kissimmee****, Florida**.** **Volunteers in **Mobile****, Alabama** assisted HIV/AIDS patients with daily living tasks, such as landscaping and housework. In both **New Orleans****, Louisiana** and** Biloxi, Mississippi,** students served by assisting in the continuing efforts to clean up post-Katrina wreckage. Students built a playground at a primary school and taught forty schoolchildren lessons for the week in **St. Elizabeth****, Jamaica**. In **Tahlequah****, Oklahoma**, volunteers helped lay PVC piping on the local waterline project as well as tending to other routine tasks within the Cherokee Nation. Volunteers worked at a camp in **Killeen****, Texas** for children with special needs and chronic illnesses.
