I just read an interesting (and alarming) <a title="Censorship and Security Agents" href="http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i38/38a00104.htm" target="_blank">article</a> in <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em> about education in Egypt.  I know some people who have studied and taught there-some liked it, and some hated it-but all were pretty vague and general in describing their experiences.  Andrew Mills's article certainly paints a bleak picture.  I'd like to visit Egypt and read <a title="Egypt Game" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/asnyder%2C+zilpha/asnyder+zilpha/1%2C1%2C10%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=asnyder+zilpha+keatley&amp;4%2C%2C10/indexsort=-" target="_blank">quite</a> <a title="Night Train" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/apeters%2C+elizabeth/apeters+elizabeth/1%2C3%2C15%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=apeters+elizabeth&amp;10%2C%2C13/indexsort=-" target="_blank">a bit</a> about it when I was younger, but I haven't been yet.

Has anyone visited or studied there?  What were your experiences like?
