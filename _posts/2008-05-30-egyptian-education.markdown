I just read an interesting (and alarming) [article](http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i38/38a00104.htm) in _The Chronicle of Higher Education_ about education in Egypt.  I know some people who have studied and taught there-some liked it, and some hated it-but all were pretty vague and general in describing their experiences.  Andrew Mills's article certainly paints a bleak picture.  I'd like to visit Egypt and read [quite](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/asnyder%2C+zilpha/asnyder+zilpha/1%2C1%2C10%2CE/frameset&FF=asnyder+zilpha+keatley&4%2C%2C10/indexsort=-) [a bit](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search?/apeters%2C+elizabeth/apeters+elizabeth/1%2C3%2C15%2CE/frameset&FF=apeters+elizabeth&10%2C%2C13/indexsort=-) about it when I was younger, but I haven't been yet.

Has anyone visited or studied there?  What were your experiences like?
