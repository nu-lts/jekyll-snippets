The article is about his new book <em>Of Spies and Spokesmen</em>; and his brief arrest in the Soviet Union, which Gorbachev has since admitted was in retaliation for the U.S. arrest of a Soviet spy.  (Interestingly, the article fails to mention that, as usual, the Reagan administration bargained with the Soviets for Daniloff's release, releasing the Soviet spy in exchange.) Ah, the Cold War.  Seems like a playground kickball game compared to the foreign policy problems we have now!

Daniloff's new book is <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/record=b2169400a">available at Snell Library</a> and excerpts are in the <a href="http://press.umsystem.edu/media/daniloff.htm" target="_blank">U.Missouri Press Media Kit.</a>
