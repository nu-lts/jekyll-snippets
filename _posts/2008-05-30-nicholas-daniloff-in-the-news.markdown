![Book Cover: Of Spies and Spokesmen](http://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&Password=neuniv&Return=1&type=S&Value=9780826217936&Options=Y)NU's own [Nicholas Daniloff, an NU professor of journalism](http://www.journalism.neu.edu/people/) and former library [Meet the Author panelist](http://hdl.handle.net/2047/d10001335) (with Khassan Baiev in '04) is featured in [an article in this week's U.S. News and World Report](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/api/version1/sr?shr=t&csi=8065&sr=BYLINE(Thomas+Omestad)+AND+HLEAD(Playing+a+Walk-on+Role+in+a+Great+20th-Century+Drama)+AND+DATE+IS+May+26+2008).  The article is about his new book _Of Spies and Spokesmen_; and his brief arrest in the Soviet Union, which Gorbachev has since admitted was in retaliation for the U.S. arrest of a Soviet spy.  (Interestingly, the article fails to mention that, as usual, the Reagan administration bargained with the Soviets for Daniloff's release, releasing the Soviet spy in exchange.) Ah, the Cold War.  Seems like a playground kickball game compared to the foreign policy problems we have now!

Daniloff's new book is [available at Snell Library](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/record=b2169400a) and excerpts are in the [U.Missouri Press Media Kit.](http://press.umsystem.edu/media/daniloff.htm)
