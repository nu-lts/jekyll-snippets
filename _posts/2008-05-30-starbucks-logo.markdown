I guess there are some folks out there who think the Starbucks siren logo is a wee bit naughty - [this post](http://www.deadprogrammer.com/starbucks-logo-mermaid) details the history of the logo. We've come a long way since the 15th century! It's pretty interesting - and one of the updates includes some comments and images from the guy who designed the green logo.
