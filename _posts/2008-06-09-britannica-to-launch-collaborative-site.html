<a href="http://britannicanet.com/?p=86" target="_blank">Britannica has just announced</a> that it's developing what seems to be a parallel site in which end-users can contribute content to the Encyclopedia as they do in Wikipedia.  It looks like the user-contributed content will appear side by side with their original content (which will be marked "Britannica checked" to distinguish it from the flotsam and jetsam of the hoi polloi).  A <a href="http://www.britannica.com/bps/home" target="_blank">beta version of the new Britannical Online</a> is available.

It's not clear to me exactly how the user-contributed content is going to be associated with the <a href="http://0-www.search.eb.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/" target="_blank">regular academic Encyclopedia Britannica</a>, which NU has already by subscription. When I go to the new site it thinks I'm logged in, and recognizes me as "Northeastern University," although I don't seem to be able to actually contribute anything (not that I'm sure what I could/would contribute).

I have some quarrels with the new site, notably the insufferable amount of advertising especially for a subscription service.  Some small things, like a "return to home page" button have probably just been overlooked since this is still beta.  I like the article layout better than the traditional encyclopedia site.   Another good thing and a plus over Wikipedia is that all the content will be signed and contributors (yes, that means you!) will submit a profile, no anonymous posting allowed.
