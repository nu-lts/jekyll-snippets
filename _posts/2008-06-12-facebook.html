The Library has a facebook group: <a title="I love NU Libraries" href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=4847549134" target="_blank">I Love NU Libraries! </a> Joining is a great way to stay up to date on Library events, as well as show your support for the Library.  Join and invite student and faculty friends to do the same.  You can also see promotional videos, along with photos and recordings of past events.  For the fall semester, were going to be looking to increase discussion about our program authors and their books, through the facebook group.  Stay tuned!
