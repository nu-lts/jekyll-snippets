I read about Green Print in Popular Science. It is software that you can download (Buy) and it will help you save on those annoying print outs that have only one useless line of text.

Here is the URL for the flash demo: <a href="http://printgreener.com/tutorial.html">http://printgreener.com/tutorial.html</a>

This could be one of those things that can make a big difference in student's lives, conserving page prints  within the 400 page limit.
