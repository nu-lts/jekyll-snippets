Observation: Three pages worth of twitters...not so much fun to read, not informative. It's like reading a couple thousand lines of chat backlog.

I signed up for Twitter when I read that SLA (Special Library Assocation) had set up an account for backchannel chatter at this year's conference. Sounded fine to me, but I think in practice, it's just too much. BUT. I could see where it would be fun if you were keeping up with specific friends and colleagues at a conference or other large event because in those cases, I'd *care* about their flights and how long they are waiting for a table at a restaurant. Random people I don't know...not so much.

I wonder how many pages of conference twitters will accumlate tomorrow, after it's in full swing! I haven't heard about using Twitter for conferences, not sure how well it's worked or what other people have thought about it. Perhaps people like myself will just lurk and mostly not read the posts while a few groups take better advantage of it.
