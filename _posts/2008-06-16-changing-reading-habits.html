I just read an interesting piece from the latest <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, entitled <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google" title="go to article" target="_blank">Is Google Making Us Stupid?</a> The author, Nicholas Carr, observes that he and colleagues have all noticed a change in their reading habits -- an inability to concentrate or focus when reading texts longer than a page or two. I've noticed this myself -- I've become far more distractible when reading, especially when reading online, where I may link from article to article without ever finishing one. Or I may skip one entirely, dismissing it as "too long," if it involves more than one full scrolling of the screen. When and how did this happen? Since when is a two-page article "too long"? It bothers me that I find it so difficult to sit down and pay attention to a <em>book</em> for any length of time these days (unless it's a really compelling book, and I do still find some of those around, luckily) -- I'm a <em>librarian</em>, after all! :) Have others noticed this phenomenon? Does it bother you, and if so, have you found ways to overcome it? (And if it doesn't bother you, why not?)
