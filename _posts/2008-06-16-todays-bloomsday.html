June 16, the day Joyce's "Ulysses" takes place, is the time to have a Guiness, <a href="http://publicliterature.org/books/ulysses/xaa.php">re-read your favorite passages</a> (also <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300">here</a>) or, if you're near a radio or computer tonight, listen to <a href="http://wbai.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10004&amp;Itemid=1">WBAI in New York which is broadcasting</a> some passages read aloud, along with period music.  In the Boston area, there's a <a href="http://ncacboston.org/present_exhibition.asp?id=65">festival on the Boston College Campus</a>, and another at <a href="http://calendar.boston.com/waltham-ma/venues/show/867590-back-pages-books">Back Pages Books in Waltham</a>.
