The library, with a partially respectful nod to the SC's recent partial protection of [_Habeas Corpus_](http://www.alternet.org/rights/88007/), might be the last functional democratic institution around. Serves the _demos_, check. Equality, check. Transparency, check. Meritocratic,  check. You get the point.

But, check this. Librarians subvert, like founding fathers but different imperials and less with the slavery and Caucasian patriarchy. They actually care about information and an [informed, civil society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent:_The_Political_Economy_of_the_Mass_Media), that is, news. I mean real news: the stuff that "[they](http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/87625/?ses=bae27808c192334ab5c2037650ed0f76)" don't want you to know, and not the standard gossip columns, celeb reviews, and adverts that are sold between commercials at 6, 10 and now at 11 as well. News about the restriction of news just doesn't seem to make it on the telly so much.

Back to the librarians. The [American Library Association](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-admin/www.ala.org) has a commando called the Intellectual Freedom Committee. Unlike most committees, this one doesn't suck. Instead, it puts out a [_Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom_](http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/oifprograms/ifpubs/nif/newsletterintellectual.cfm)--a real news source.  You just probably never heard of it because it is a real news source and thus non-profitable and sometimes embarrassing to the point of being anti-profitable and thus democratic. This library has this title in current periodicals @ Z1.N7400 or for you Law folks out there, click [here](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xnewsletter+on+intellectual+freedom&SORT=D/Xnewsletter+on+intellectual+freedom&SORT=D&SUBKEY=newsletter%20on%20intellectual%20freedom/1%2C2%2C2%2CE/frameset&FF=Xnewsletter+on+intellectual+freedom&SORT=D&2%2C2%2C) to get started.

This is just one little tidbit of the system busting stuff that lives in the Library. Don't tell anyone, because if the word gets out, the rules might change and information might not flow anymore...say in something called the [Patriot Act](http://www.ala.org/ala/washoff/woissues/civilliberties/theusapatriotact/usapatriotact.cfm)...
