Rebecca's post and its ideas about how the ways we read and think may be changing led me to want to share <a title="Portfolio" href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/columns/media/2008/06/16/Jim-Romeneskos-Impact-on-Journalism" target="_blank">a recent article </a>about how journalism is changing in these ways too.  It focuses specifically on the figure of media blogger Jim Romensko, and it's written by Howell Raines. One quote really stuck out to me:
<blockquote>Newspaper publishers assumed that even if the printing press disappeared, the internet would still have an insatiable need for their basic product-verified facts, hierarchically arranged by importance. But Romenesko's rapid growth showed that even newsrooms are part of the emerging market for an unprocessed sprawl of information, delivered immediately and with as few filters as possible between the fingertips of one laptop user and the eyeballs of another. In short, it's not technology per se that's killing newspapers; it's plummeting demand for quality information.</blockquote>
What do you think? Sometimes I worry that I too, have developed a taste for new, unverified and immediate information-I feel panicked by the thought that something hugely significant could be happening that I have no idea of, but I must find out about it right away.  Or do you think that Raines has a biased (and possibly bitter) view?

Roy Harris, author of <em>Pulitzer's Gold </em>spoke about the history of public service journalism this spring, as part of the Library's Meet the Author Series.  He specifically talks about Howell Raines, Gerald Boyd and the Jason Blair scandal.
