<a href="http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1816198,00.html">Time Magazine reports</a> that, despite the Knopf promotional material ("Here, too, are her relationships with men â€” in and out of her marriages..."), the audio verson of the memoirs of prominent journalist and apparent roundheel Barbara Walters completely omits the two chapters from the printed book in which she discusses her extramarital affairs.  Apparently the decision to omit was made by Walters herself.  But was there any other reason anyone wanted to read--or listen--to this book? Caveat emptor, audio-book-buyers!
