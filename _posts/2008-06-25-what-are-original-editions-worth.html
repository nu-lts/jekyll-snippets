At nearby Margaret Clapp Library at Wellesley College, <a title="Boston Globe article " href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2008/06/17/wellesley_college_acquires_copernicuss_masterpiece/" target="_blank">students have been able to pore over the 1566 printing of Copernicus's <em>On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres</em></a>.  It's the third such "threshold work" for science-the Library has first printings of Charles Darwin's <em>On the Origin of Species</em> and Isaac Newton's <em>Principia Mathematica</em>-in the Wellesley collection.  Reading about this acquisition made me think: How different is the experience of reading a first or second printing?  Does more power lie in the text, or the book? What sort of impact does it have on a student's study?
