At nearby Margaret Clapp Library at Wellesley College, [students have been able to pore over the 1566 printing of Copernicus's _On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres_](http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2008/06/17/wellesley_college_acquires_copernicuss_masterpiece/).  It's the third such "threshold work" for science-the Library has first printings of Charles Darwin's _On the Origin of Species_ and Isaac Newton's _Principia Mathematica_-in the Wellesley collection.  Reading about this acquisition made me think: How different is the experience of reading a first or second printing?  Does more power lie in the text, or the book? What sort of impact does it have on a student's study?
