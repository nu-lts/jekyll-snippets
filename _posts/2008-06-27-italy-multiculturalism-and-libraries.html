Italy, (along with most European countries), has experienced an influx of immigrants in last few years, and with that there have been some ongoing (and escalating) tensions down racial and ethnic lines.  This has also been reflected in the election of an increasingly conservative government.   While this recent <em>New York Times</em> <a title="NY Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/arts/design/25abroad.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2" target="_blank">article</a> certainly demonstrates a mixed outlook, I was pleased to see that the reporter interviewed two Italian librarians who were trying to promote cultural diversity in their country and the ways in which libraries and art organizations are uniquely positioned to do that.
