I think_ [Rebecca ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/cPR6007.U47+R4+1993/cpr+6007+u47+r4+1993/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FF=cpr+6007+u47+r4+1993&1%2C1%2C)_by Daphne Du Maurier typifies the perfect summer read.  It's atmospheric and has one of the most famous opening lines: "Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again."  It borrows liberally from past gothic plots (most obviously _Jane Eyre_) and also manages to make more over the top, an already pretty over the top genre.  It's chock-full of romance, secrets, jealousy and revenge. 




 




This book is one I'd recommend checking out from Snell Library to read over the summer, and it's also featured in the Summer Staff Picks exhibit on the first floor of the Library.
