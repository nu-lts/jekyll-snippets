Tasha Tudor, born in Boston, died at age 92 a week ago last Thursday.  Her lovely illustrations for children's books seem like they are from the nineteenth century, so much so that I'm not sure I realized she was still living until I heard the news.   I remember being transported by her pictures in a book of fairy tales (shown at left) when I was a little girl.  Like Garth Williams and Beatrix Potter they are really grown-up art, art that shows a deep respect for children and their imaginations, art to transport children to some lofty, magical place, the opposite of everyday and mundane.  Anyone else have any favorites?
