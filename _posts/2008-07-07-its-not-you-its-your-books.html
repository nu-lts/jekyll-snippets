<a title="It's Not You" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/books/review/Donadio-t.html?scp=1&amp;sq=it%27s+not+you+it%27s+your+books&amp;st=nyt " target="_blank">This <em>NY Times</em> Sunday Book Review essay </a>was written several months ago-a good friend sent it to me at the time, and pointed out the tragic humor of the Isabel Archer/Gilbert Osmond example.  I found the essay to be a very humorous and interesting one, and I shared it with family members.  They however were not as pleased!  They thought it demonstrated caring far too much about insignificant details.  I recently met someone and the essay topic came up again, as he knows the essayist and had gotten into a disagreement with her about it when the essay came out.  It's an essay that seems to be polarizing, and so I'm interested to hear what others-bookish or not-have to say!

I must say, that I also cringe when I hear people claim to <strong>love </strong>Ayn Rand (often celebrity actors and Alan Greenspan).  But I did think it was a bit funny for this essay to call out Rand enthusiasts-as the <em>Times</em> had not that long before <a title="Literary Capitalism" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/business/15atlas.html?adxnnl=1&amp;dlbk=&amp;adxnnlx=1215446517-eP/djrteqmeHhSRlD3Xldw " target="_blank">published an article </a>on the success of Rand devotees in the financial world.
