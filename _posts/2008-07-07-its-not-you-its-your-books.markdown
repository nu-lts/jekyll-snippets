[This _NY Times_ Sunday Book Review essay ](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/books/review/Donadio-t.html?scp=1&sq=it%27s+not+you+it%27s+your+books&st=nyt )was written several months ago-a good friend sent it to me at the time, and pointed out the tragic humor of the Isabel Archer/Gilbert Osmond example.  I found the essay to be a very humorous and interesting one, and I shared it with family members.  They however were not as pleased!  They thought it demonstrated caring far too much about insignificant details.  I recently met someone and the essay topic came up again, as he knows the essayist and had gotten into a disagreement with her about it when the essay came out.  It's an essay that seems to be polarizing, and so I'm interested to hear what others-bookish or not-have to say!

I must say, that I also cringe when I hear people claim to **love **Ayn Rand (often celebrity actors and Alan Greenspan).  But I did think it was a bit funny for this essay to call out Rand enthusiasts-as the _Times_ had not that long before [published an article ](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/business/15atlas.html?adxnnl=1&dlbk=&adxnnlx=1215446517-eP/djrteqmeHhSRlD3Xldw )on the success of Rand devotees in the financial world.
