One of my favorite summer traditions has started up again with <a title="MYSTERY" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/index.html" target="_blank">MYSTERY! on PBS</a>.  This summer they seem to be featuring Inspector Lewis, Foyle's War and the Inspector Lynley Mysteries.  And it looks like it will be the final season for both Foyle's War and Inspector Lynley.  I'm not crazy about their credits redesign and Alan Cumming as host, but I always love a good British mystery.  I also find that most British productions feature the same rotating crew of about 80 actors, so there's always a familiar face.

The Inspector Lynley and Lewis mysteries are also based on literary detectives-<a title="Elizabeth George" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/ageorge+elizabeth/ageorge+elizabeth/1%2C2%2C14%2CE/2exact&amp;FF=ageorge+elizabeth&amp;1%2C13%2C/indexsort=-" target="_blank">Elizabeth George </a>writes the popular Lynley mysteries and Inspector Lewis is a spin-off of <a title="Inspector Morse" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13/?searchtype=a&amp;searcharg=dexter+colin&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=1&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=tinspector+morse" target="_blank">Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse </a>series.  You can pick up one of these at Snell Library today!
