One of my favorite trips in the summer months is to...<a title="Copley Station" href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/?stopId=15593&amp;lat=42.349991&amp;lng=-71.077463" target="_blank">Copley Square</a>. You know how there's a <a title="Boston Public Library" href="http://www.bpl.org/" target="_blank">big library</a> right there at the <a title="MBTA Green Line" href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/?route=GREEN" target="_blank">Green Line</a> stop? Well, right across from it, on Tuesdays and Fridays from 11am to 6pm, there is a farmers market. There are <a title="list of vendors" href="http://www.massfarmersmarkets.org/t-bostoncopley-vendors.aspx" target="_blank">many farms represented here</a>, all selling delicious locally grown produce (and some are certified organic).

In addition to produce, you can shop for uh, <a title="copley vendor for pottery" href="http://www.helennajarian.com/">pottery</a>. You can get sammiches, pizza, and breads from <a title="Iggy's" href="http://www.iggysbread.com/main.html" target="_blank">Iggy's Bread</a>. Sometimes there is a stand for Equal Exchange coffee. The goat cheese picnic lunch guy is there. Stillman Farms is also there with their coolers of meats. You can buy pies, cookies, brownies, honey, flowers, herbs and nut breads.

If you can't make it to the one in Copley Square, try <a title="Guide to MA farmers markets" href="http://www.massfarmersmarkets.org/t-allmarkets.aspx" target="_blank">finding another one</a>! And when you go, make sure to take plenty of cash.
