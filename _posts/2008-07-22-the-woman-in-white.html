<a title="Woman in White" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/cPR4494+.W5+2003/cpr+4494+w5+2003/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=cpr+4494+w5+2003&amp;1%2C1%2C" target="_blank"><em>The Woman in White</em> by Wilkie Collins </a>is a great (and lengthy) summer mystery read.  <img class="alignright" style="float: right; margin: 15px;" src="http://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&amp;Password=neuniv&amp;Return=T&amp;type=L&amp;Value=0141439610&amp;Options=Y" alt="" width="122" height="134" />Walter Hartright, a struggling artist, is about to begin a new career as a tutor to half-sisters Marian Halcombe and Laura Fairlie.  Just before he leaves London for Cumberland, he encounters a mysterious ‘woman in white,' in evident distress.  I won't reveal too much more of the plot, but this 1859 novel deals with powerlessness (of women in particular) in the face of injustice.

Have any of you read Collins before?  (I also really liked <em><a title="Moonstone" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/aCollins,+Wilkie,+1824-1889./acollins+wilkie+1824+1889/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=acollins+wilkie+1824+1889&amp;34%2C%2C63" target="_blank">The Moonstone</a></em>).  What do you think?
