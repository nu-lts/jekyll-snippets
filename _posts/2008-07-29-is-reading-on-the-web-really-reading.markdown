Here I go again on the subject of the Internet and our changing reading habits. I just finished reading a [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/books/27reading.html?ex=1374897600&en=81a364206914f90a&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink) (yes, I read it online) (also, be warned, it's LONG for a web article) focusing on children and teenagers and whether the reading they do on the Internet is as valuable for their intellectual development as reading books. It reports that the number of teens who read _books_ for pleasure is down, according to surveys -- but does that matter, if they are still reading for pleasure but now primarily from online sources? The article discusses both sides of the issue and doesn't draw any conclusions one way or the other, but it's interesting food for thought. Do you think kids get the same value from reading blogs, online fan fiction, and so on, as they do from reading novels or nonfiction books?
