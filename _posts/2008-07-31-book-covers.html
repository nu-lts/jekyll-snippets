Today I read <a title="Blog Post" href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2008/07/30/chick_lit/index.html  " target="_self">a little piece on book covers</a>-why books written by women (or featuring female <img class="alignright" style="float: right; margin: 15px;" src="http://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&amp;Password=neuniv&amp;Return=T&amp;type=L&amp;Value=0385335482%20(pbk.)&amp;Options=Y" alt="" width="156" height="193" />protagonists)-<a title="the Guardian" href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/07/the_great_chick_lit_coverup.html" target="_blank">are often pink or otherwise "girly," even when that doesn't jibe with the book's subject matter</a>.  When I'm at the bookstore or library, covers certainly draw my attention to a book-I'm tempted to pick up those that look ‘fun' but not too silly or cheap.  I've certainly picked up some that would seem to fall into the ‘chick lit' category, only to put them down again after reading back jackets that seem to describe a much more depressing story.  What do you think of this type of advertising? One chick lit book that I've read and enjoyed is <a title="Confessions of a Shopaholic" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/akinsella%2C+sophie/akinsella+sophie/1%2C2%2C6%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=akinsella+sophie&amp;1%2C%2C5/indexsort=-" target="_blank"><em>Confessions of a Shopaholic</em> by Sophie Kinsella</a>.

(If you enjoy book cover design, Stephanie had recommended the hilarious <a title="Judge a Book" href="http://judgeabook.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">"Judge a Book by it's Cover" blog</a>.)
