Every summer the [Commonwealth Shakespeare Company](http://www.commshakes.org/) puts on a free performance of one of Shakespeare's plays on the Boston Common. This year's show, [_As You Like It_](http://www.citicenter.org/shows/lists/details.php?showID=423), is currently being performed at the Parkman Bandstand on the Common. [_As You Like It_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xas+you+like+it&searchscope=13&SORT=DZ/Xas+you+like+it&searchscope=13&SORT=DZ&extended=1&SUBKEY=as%20you%20like%20it/1%2C99%2C99%2CE/frameset&FF=Xas+you+like+it&searchscope=13&SORT=DZ&4%2C4%2C) is a comedy about love, loyalty and friendship. I had not previously read or seen this particular play but I very much enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. It's playing now through Sunday August 3rd. So, if you like Shakespeare, or are just looking for something to do that won't cost you anything, grab some friends and a picnic and head down to the Boston Common.
