I have an assignment for the next two weeks: listen to some rock music and identify the accents in the guitar riffs. I'm sure it's okay if I listen to blues, too, so I went on over to iTunes and found a few songs in various genres that I thought would be great.

Thankfully, I remembered that we probably have some good stuff in our collection before I went hogwild with Leadbelly purchases. And there's lots of other recordings of American roots music. Now to remember all this when I'm actually at the library.

I've got lots of listening to do!
