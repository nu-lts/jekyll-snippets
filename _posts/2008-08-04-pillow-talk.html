One of my childhood friends really loved the movie <em>Pillow Talk</em>, but I'd never actually seen it until I <a title="Pillow Talk" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xpillow+talk&amp;SORT=D/Xpillow+talk&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=pillow%20talk/1%2C9%2C9%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xpillow+talk&amp;SORT=D&amp;2%2C2%2C" target="_blank">checked it out from the Library last week.</a>  I found it to be a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it.  It's about a young career woman, Jan, (played by Doris Day) who shares a ‘party line' (basically a phone line) with lothario composer Brad (played by Rock Hudson).  

Phone lines are so scarce that Jan can't get her own, and Brad continues to hog the line, singing "original" tribute songs to different women.  Eventually the two meet, and Brad adopts the persona of Texan Rex Stetson in order to woo Jan.  The movie seemed to be a little risqué for the 1950s, and I think it's still a pretty clever romantic comedy.
