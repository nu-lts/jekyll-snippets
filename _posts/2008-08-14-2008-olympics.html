Has anyone been watching the Olympics?  Which sports do you like best?  I've been enjoying watching these Olympic games.  I really liked the opening ceremonies, but I've always been an easy mark for big pageantry and production numbers.  I like watching basketball, swimming and gymnastics, and I'm looking forward to seeing more tennis and soccer.  I also hope to get a chance to see some of the less-broadcast sports like equestrian events, badminton, archery and the pentathlon.  On the <a title="IOC" href="http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/past/index_uk.asp" target="_blank">IOC's website</a> I also learned about Olympic sports of the past, including polo, rugby and tug-of-war, which I would have liked to watch!  As any broadcast is also jam-packed with advertising, my favorite Olympic commercial so far, has been <a title="Nike" href="http://www.nike.com/nikeos/p/nike/en_US/courage" target="_blank">this one</a>.  And I'd say my favorite Olympic film is the classic <em>Chariots of Fire</em>, which is <a title="NUCAT" href=" http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xchariots+of+fire&amp;SORT=D/Xchariots+of+fire&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=chariots%20of%20fire/1%2C3%2C3%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xchariots+of+fire&amp;SORT=D&amp;1%2C1%2C" target="_blank">available at Snell</a>.
