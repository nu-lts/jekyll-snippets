Has anyone been watching the Olympics?  Which sports do you like best?  I've been enjoying watching these Olympic games.  I really liked the opening ceremonies, but I've always been an easy mark for big pageantry and production numbers.  I like watching basketball, swimming and gymnastics, and I'm looking forward to seeing more tennis and soccer.  I also hope to get a chance to see some of the less-broadcast sports like equestrian events, badminton, archery and the pentathlon.  On the [IOC's website](http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/past/index_uk.asp) I also learned about Olympic sports of the past, including polo, rugby and tug-of-war, which I would have liked to watch!  As any broadcast is also jam-packed with advertising, my favorite Olympic commercial so far, has been [this one](http://www.nike.com/nikeos/p/nike/en_US/courage).  And I'd say my favorite Olympic film is the classic _Chariots of Fire_, which is [available at Snell]( http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xchariots+of+fire&SORT=D/Xchariots+of+fire&SORT=D&SUBKEY=chariots%20of%20fire/1%2C3%2C3%2CE/frameset&FF=Xchariots+of+fire&SORT=D&1%2C1%2C).
