![](http://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&Password=neuniv&Return=T&type=L&Value=0141439777%20(pbk.)&Options=Y)I finished [Laurence Sterne's _Tristram Shandy_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xshandy&SORT=D/Xshandy&SORT=D&SUBKEY=shandy/1%2C32%2C32%2CE/frameset&FF=Xshandy&SORT=D&2%2C2%2C), another one of [my TBR 2008 Challenge books.](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/index.php?p=81)  This is often hailed as the first post-modern text, and a few years ago, I saw a film adaptation [A Cock and Bull Story](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423409/), which I found to be a lot of fun.  So I was quite looking forward to this.  It's a (very) rambling story where the narrator recounts his birth-paying particular attention to circumstances surrounding his conception, his father, and his uncle Toby.  Sterne has no compunction about breaking off a chapter, just as it's about to reach a resolution.  It's a narrative of interruptions, and so it requires a good deal of focus to follow the novel's train(s) of thought. 

Have any of you read it? What did you think?
