I just read [this NY Times article, on Sarah Palin's career as mayor of Wasilla, AK](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/us/politics/03wasilla.html?_r=1&oref=slogin).  One incident really jumped out at me--her experience with the town library, librarians, and possibly censoring books (or at least having that discussion).  It surprised me a bit that this would be occuring at the level of a town mayor--has anyone heard any other stories like this?  Any thoughts?
