Once again, the Research & Instruction department held its annual Pinball Tournament. R&I Librarians competed for a deluxe championship prize in this annual event. Previous champion (yours truly) got the contestants on track, made sure flippers worked and that the contestants knew how to find the controls. For 30 minutes, the sounds of pinball filled the room.

Winner was Sandy Dunphy, with a top score of 3,915,000 points.

I'd post a few photos, but nothing will load them up.

Congratulations to Sandy, our new Pinball champion!
