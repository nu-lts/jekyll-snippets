Tomorrow @ Noon, Snell Library will host former NFL player Mark Bavaro and footbal statistician Aaron Schatz.  The two are discussing their repective books, [_Rough & Tumble_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xrough+and+tumble&SORT=D/Xrough+and+tumble&SORT=D&SUBKEY=rough%20and%20tumble/1%2C11%2C11%2CE/frameset&FF=Xrough+and+tumble&SORT=D&1%2C1%2C), and [_Pro Football Prospectus_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xpro+football&searchscope=13&SORT=DZ/Xpro+football&searchscope=13&SORT=DZ&extended=1&SUBKEY=pro%20football/1%2C12%2C12%2CE/frameset&FF=Xpro+football&searchscope=13&SORT=DZ&1%2C1%2C).  Join us in 90 Snell for a spirited kick-off of one of the season's great pleasures--football (and [the Meet the Author Series](http://www.lib.neu.edu/libraries_and_collections/libraries/calendar_of_events/))!
