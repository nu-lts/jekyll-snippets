<p style="center"><strong><em>Robert Johnson..........the Complete Recordings </em></strong></p>
<p style="center">      <span style="Times New Roman;">If you want a free lesson in blues and soul music, get this NOW.<span style="yes;">  </span>You don’t even have to buy it; it’s available on the second floor at the SNELL Library.<span style="yes;">  </span>Robert Johnson is the king of the delta blues.<span style="yes;">  </span>The man single-handedly started Rock N Roll with these songs, and has inspired some of your favorite bands, bands like Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The White Stripes, Eric Clapton, Cream, and the list goes on and on.</span></p>
<span style="Times New Roman;">     I forget where I first heard Robert Johnson, but I remember when I bought the complete recordings, mainly because I was never the same.<span style="yes;">  </span>I mean, THIS IS IT!<span style="yes;">  </span>This is what music is all about, a man pouring his soul out just in his words and his guitar.<span style="yes;">  </span>While each song sounds eerily similar to the last, there is a nice variation in the lyrical content, and the mood of the albums is just………….almost creepy.<span style="yes;">  </span>There’s an amazing vibe that is captured on these recordings…………and as far as I’m concerned, it’s a “must listen” to any music fan.</span>
