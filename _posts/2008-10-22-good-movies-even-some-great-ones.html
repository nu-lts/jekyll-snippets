<p class="MsoNormal" style="0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Snell Library has an impressive selection of DVD’s, and the DVD section is u<img class="alignright" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="http://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&amp;Password=neuniv&amp;Return=T&amp;type=L&amp;Value=0780030303&amp;Options=Y" alt="" width="310" height="396" />ndeniably something that has improved over the past two years. I mean this in an entirely physical sense: the DVD’s, VHS’s and the books on movies have wisely been integrated together, in to a well-organized cinema-in-general section, which spans most of the PN call numbers on the third floor shelves. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Since there are not many good video stores in Boston, and not many cheap or nearby Movie Theaters, Snell Library is the best place here to rent a DVD. Since you can stop at the Library to rent a DVD, it is also advisable that you rent something that is not the standard fare you will be finding at the <a title="AMC Theaters" href="http://www.amctheaters.com/" target="_self">LOEWS</a> by Boston Common, or in a <a href="http://www.blockbuster.com/">Blockbuster</a>; I am aware that I am speaking largely to Cinema Studies Majors and Minors with this suggestion, but so be it. I would recommend a good Japanese film such as <em><a title="Internet Movie Database" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046478/" target="_self">Ugetsu</a> </em>(1953). <em>Ugetsu</em> is for anybody who is interested in Film History, Japanese History, or just Beauty. It was directed by Kenji Mizoguchi, a nowadays seldom- mentioned Japanese filmmaker who turned out a prolific amount of work that was once regarded as some of the best stuff Cinema had to offer. <em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xugetsu&amp;SORT=D/Xugetsu&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=ugetsu/1%2C5%2C5%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xugetsu&amp;SORT=D&amp;1%2C1%2C">Ugetsu</a></em> has some of the most graceful, eye-pleasing Black-and-White imagery that can be found in Japanese Cinema, and is one of the few films to my mind that succeeds as a strange blending of several different genres; it is an Adventure story, a Ghost story, a Tragic Love story, a Period/Costume piece, and occasionally a dark comedy. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="small;"></span><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Don’t be afraid by the age of the film: it has been restored to a crisp image by the <a href="http://www.criterion.com/asp/">Criterion Collection</a>, and is very well subtitled. See it while you can. </span></span></p>
