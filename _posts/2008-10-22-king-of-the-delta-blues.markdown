**_Robert Johnson………..the Complete Recordings_**




If you want a free lesson in blues and soul music, get this NOW.  You don’t even have to buy it; it’s available on the second floor at the SNELL Library.  [Robert Johnson ](http://www.deltahaze.com/30/rj.html)is the king of the delta blues.  The man single-handedly started Rock N Roll with these songs, and has inspired some of your favorite bands, bands like Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The White Stripes, Eric Clapton, Cream, and the list goes on and on.




I forget where I first heard Robert Johnson, but I remember when I bought the complete recordings, mainly because I was never the same.  I mean, [THIS IS IT](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/ajohnson%2C+robert/ajohnson+robert/1%2C65%2C115%2CE/frameset&FF=ajohnson+robert+d+1938&7%2C%2C8)!  This is what music is all about, a man pouring his soul out just in his words and his guitar.  While each song sounds eerily similar to the last, there is a nice variation in the lyrical content, and the moods of the albums are just………….almost creepy.  There’s an amazing vibe that is captured on these recordings and as far as I’m concerned, it’s a must listen for any music fan.
