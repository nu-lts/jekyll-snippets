Hi everyone -- just wanted to remind you all to make sure you vote today! I won't push my view on anyone, but this is what democracy is all about. Whoever your candidate is -- make sure your voice is heard! :) And if you're interested in some good election and polling analysis, one place you can find it is [www.fivethirtyeight.com](http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/).
