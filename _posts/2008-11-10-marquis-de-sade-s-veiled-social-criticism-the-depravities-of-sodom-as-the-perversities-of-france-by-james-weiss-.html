<em>Les Cent vingt Journees de Sodome (The 120 Days of Sodom</em>) is considered one of the most perverse books ever written by many people, but it is not very well known in the mainstream literary world. There was an Italian film adaptation of it made in 1975 called <em>Salo, the 120 Days of Sodom</em>, set during WWII rather than 19th century France, and it is considered one of the mos perverse films ever made. NU professor James Weiss has recently written his own analysis of <em>The 120 Days of Sodom</em>, which is not too different on the surface, than most other analyses of  the book: that the story is an allegory of France at the time, and an indictment of authoritarianism and repression of all forms. But Weiss digs deeper, going in to De Sade's own life, as well as drawing parallels between the book and Dante's <em>Divine Comedy</em>, among other historical works. The book does this all in only 100 pages.
