If you feel like you would like to learn about new web social networking sites--and how to use basic software--and you don't want to go to a conference to learn, <a href="http://www.teachertrainingvideos.com">www.teachertrainingvideos.com</a> has great videos on basics or special applications using Second Life, Flikr, Audacity and around 40 others.Â  They may not be as good as ElementK, but they cover new technologies that ElementK may not have. The target audience is teachers and the focus is how to use these technologies to improve your teaching.
