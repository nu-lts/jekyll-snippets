Anthony Bozza used to write for Rolling Stone Magazine but lately has been co-authoring books by some of Hollywood's biggest names.  He has co-written with Tommy Lee, Eminem, and his latest and most successful; former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash.  

     Bozza's books are impossible to put down.  I received a few copies of the book, "Slash" for Christmas last year (I'm a HUGE Guns N' Roses fan), and even though it was almost 500 pages, I couldn't stop reading!  I finished it in 3 days, even SKIPPED CLASSES to continue reading.  I think the most incredible part of Bozza's work with Slash was taking someone who did enough drugs and drinking to kill a small farmtown, and helping him remember specific stories during the height of his excessive lifestyle.  Nevertheless, the book is clear, concise, and HILARIOUS!  The stories in the book are jaw-dropping!  Above being a memoir, the book also clears up a lot of the reason why he left the band while they were still at the top and sets straight a lot of the rumors that have been circling around. 

     Bozza is continually working with new celebrities, and has many new releases scheduled for 2008-2009.  Check out upcoming books on Kat Von D, Artie Lang, Tracey Morgan, and more upcoming in the next couple of years.  If you are a fan of rock music, or any of the aforementioned artists/comedians mentioned, you should definitely check out the works of Anthony Bozza.  His aforementioned style is really something that needs to be checked out by one and all, you'll never read anything like it!  i think that you will really enjoy what he has to say about your favorite celebrities and their stories that have happene din their past which have happened before you can ever even think to say HEY!  Step brothers is probably the funniest movie of all time..............I LOVE IT!  I've never seen anything like it before, I think that I'll go back to theatres and watch it again adn again and again...................
