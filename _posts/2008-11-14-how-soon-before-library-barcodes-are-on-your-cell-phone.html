Ars Technical reports that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081113-cell-phone-boarding-passes-coming-to-an-airline-near-you.html">American Airlines will start rolling out cell phone boarding passes</a> today at O'Hare international airport.  Instead of printing your boarding pass* you'll get a barcode sent to your cell which you can bring to the airport. TSA can scan it and allow you to your gate--you'll still need an ID, of course.  How soon before we can get a barcode on our cell phones for everything--supermarket key tags that get you the lower prices, and everything else including...library cards?
