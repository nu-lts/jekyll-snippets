Ars Technical reports that [American Airlines will start rolling out cell phone boarding passes](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081113-cell-phone-boarding-passes-coming-to-an-airline-near-you.html) today at O'Hare international airport.  Instead of printing your boarding pass* you'll get a barcode sent to your cell which you can bring to the airport. TSA can scan it and allow you to your gate--you'll still need an ID, of course.  How soon before we can get a barcode on our cell phones for everything--supermarket key tags that get you the lower prices, and everything else including...library cards?

*See "[Why is Printing so Hard](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/why-printing-so-hard)?" by Ed Felton, Princeton Professor and apparent leading candidate for Obama's new Chief Technology Officer position.
