I just finished reading an article on evidence based practice by audiologist Robyn M. Cox*, which cited an excellent book _How to Read a Paper: the basics of evidence based medicine_ by Trisha Greenlaugh, in the Snell Library **R118.6 .G74 1997**. Greenlaugh's book is an excellent resource for any student seeking to work in medical or therapeutic settings.

The term Evidence-Based Practice has become quite popular in the past two decades for a variety of disciplines such as psychology, occupational therapy, medicine, etc. It is an approach to practice that requires the practitioner to read and critically analyze the latest research papers, expert opinions and clinical studies. Informed by new knowledge,the practioner assesses how their current standards of care may be altered to fit a particular patient's needs. In other words, there are four courses of action: see the patient, do the reading, analyze the new information, incorporate what is useful into practice.

Seem like a lot? Well Greenlaugh breaks it down in simple steps. Her book employs suggestions on streamlined, strategized search efforts, as well as successful implementation of new information into practice. Greenlaugh also gives an easy-to-follow crash course on basic statistics analysis, how to evaluate drug trials and reviews and checklists to streamline a clinician's quest for useful information.

So its not as daunting a process as you might think. Check out Greenlaugh's book if you are interested in learning more about how to implement evidence-based practice in your future disciplines.
