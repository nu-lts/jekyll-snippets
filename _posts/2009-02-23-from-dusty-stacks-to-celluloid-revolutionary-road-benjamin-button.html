Ehrenreich's</span></span><span class="bibContentSectionDefault"><span class="bibItems"> elegant examination of a variety of historical sources and works of fiction, spins her interpretation of the changing role of man in American society from the baby boomer generation to present day. </span></span>

<span class="bibContentSectionDefault"><span class="bibItems">Chief among Ehrenreich's sources is the novel <em>Revolutionary Road</em>. Currently on hold at the library (</span></span><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search%7ES13?/cPS3575.A83+R4x+1971/cps+3575+a83+r4+x+1971/-3,-1,,E/browse">PS3575.A83 R4x 1971</a>)<span class="bibContentSectionDefault"><span class="bibItems">, this 1961 book is now a film nominated for several Academy Awards. In the summer months, I will be looking up <em>Revolutionary Road</em>, which Kurt Vonnegut referred to as,"</span></span>the <em>Great Gatsby</em> of my time... one of the best books by a member of my generation."

Speaking of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search%7ES13?/cPS3511.I9+G7+1996/cps+3511+i9+g7+1996/-3,-1,,E/browse">PS3511.I9 G7 1996</a> (a book which I inhaled in one night it was THAT good), imagine my surprise last December to discover that the film <em>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</em>, also in the running for a slew of Academy Awards, was based on a short story of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It speaks to the power of the writing medium that a 15-page story can be turned into film 166 minutes in length. Fitzgerald's <em>Button</em> as well as his other great writings, can be found in the library under <em>Jazz Age Stories</em> <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search%7ES13?/cPS3511.I9+A6+1998/cps+3511+i9+a6+1998/-3,-1,,E/browse">PS3511.I9 A6 1998</a>
