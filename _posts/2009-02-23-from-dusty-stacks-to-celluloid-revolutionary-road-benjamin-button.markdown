![](https://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&Password=neuniv&Return=T&type=L&Value=014118048X%20(pbk.)&Options=Y)My first encounter with the novel _Revolutionary Road_ was through Barbara Ehrenreich's smart volume _The Hearts of Men: American Dreams and the Flight From Commitment_ (available at the Snell Library, [HQ1090 .E36 1983](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search%7ES13?/cHQ1090+.E36+1983/chq+1090+e36+1983/-3,-1,,E/browse)). Ehrenreich's elegant examination of a variety of historical sources and works of fiction, spins her interpretation of the changing role of man in American society from the baby boomer generation to present day. 

Chief among Ehrenreich's sources is the novel _Revolutionary Road_. Currently on hold at the library ([PS3575.A83 R4x 1971](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search%7ES13?/cPS3575.A83+R4x+1971/cps+3575+a83+r4+x+1971/-3,-1,,E/browse)), this 1961 book is now a film nominated for several Academy Awards. In the summer months, I will be looking up _Revolutionary Road_, which Kurt Vonnegut referred to as,"the _Great Gatsby_ of my time... one of the best books by a member of my generation."

Speaking of _The Great Gatsby_ [PS3511.I9 G7 1996](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search%7ES13?/cPS3511.I9+G7+1996/cps+3511+i9+g7+1996/-3,-1,,E/browse) (a book which I inhaled in one night it was THAT good), imagine my surprise last December to discover that the film _The Curious Case of Benjamin Button_, also in the running for a slew of Academy Awards, was based on a short story of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It speaks to the power of the writing medium that a 15-page story can be turned into film 166 minutes in length. Fitzgerald's _Button_ as well as his other great writings, can be found in the library under _Jazz Age Stories_ [PS3511.I9 A6 1998](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search%7ES13?/cPS3511.I9+A6+1998/cps+3511+i9+a6+1998/-3,-1,,E/browse)
