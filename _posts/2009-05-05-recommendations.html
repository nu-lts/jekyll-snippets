<p class="MsoNormal" style="0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="115%;"><span style="Calibri;">As far as blog posts go, this is most likely my last for a while. I will not be around in the summer or fall of this year. In the spring of 2009, I should be back at work. Provided that this blog is still operational, I will be back to posting then. I will continue to post on the Facebook page and continue to leave comments. This is my opening disclaimer for this post.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="115%;"><span style="Calibri;">I have decided to make this a comment--oriented post. There are numerous books that I want to read in the upcoming months, but it seems that I can never get around to them. Sometimes I feel that I am being too ambitious and trying to read books that are too weighty for this time in my life, when I have a lot of things going on. But I think I will get around to reading Cormac McCarthy’s <a title="the road" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/XThe+Road&amp;SORT=D/XThe+Road&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=The%20Road/51%2C2671%2C2671%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=XThe+Road&amp;SORT=D&amp;85%2C85%2C" target="_blank"><em>The Road</em>.</a> I have heard generally good things about this book, and it seems to be very popular for a work of ‘literary fiction.’ It has been made in to a movie starring <a title="viggo" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001557/" target="_blank">Viggo Mortensen </a>that will premiere at <a title="cannes" href="http://www.festival-cannes.com/en.html" target="_blank">Cannes </a>in May. Before I see that film I will try to read this book and try not to picture Viggo Mortensen as the main character. Perhaps this will add another dimension of difficulty to the book. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="115%;"><span style="Calibri;">I also want to get around to reading, at least partly, some of <a title="pauline kael" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~/a?a" target="_blank">Pauline Kael’s </a>writings in her various collections of Film Criticism. <em>Trash, Art and the Movies</em> is her most famous essay; I don’t think I’ve ever gotten around to reading all thirty-something pages. I would like to read <a title="kane" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/XPauline+Kael&amp;SORT=D/XPauline+Kael&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=Pauline%20Kael/1%2C16%2C16%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=XPauline+Kael&amp;SORT=D&amp;8%2C8%2C" target="_blank"><em>The Citizen Kane Book: Raising Kane</em>, </a>where she argues that Orson Welles deserves more credit than is necessary for revolutionizing cinema with <em><a title="citizen" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/" target="_blank">Citizen Kane</a></em>, and even in the creation of certain aspects of the movie itself. I have read with interest other writings by Pauline Kael that I’ve read (what fan of movies hasn’t?) and feel the need to dig in to more. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="115%;"><span style="Calibri;">But I need some recommendations as well. What are other good books that Snell Library has which are worth reading? What about movies? What<span style="yes;"> </span>is a good summer read. i.e something that is sort of silly but interesting? I still have two and a half more months in Boston (before I go to New York for a spell) and still need to spend some time in the Snell stacks.</span></span></p>
