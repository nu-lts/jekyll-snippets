As far as blog posts go, this is most likely my last for a while. I will not be around in the summer or fall of this year. In the spring of 2009, I should be back at work. Provided that this blog is still operational, I will be back to posting then. I will continue to post on the Facebook page and continue to leave comments. This is my opening disclaimer for this post.




I have decided to make this a comment--oriented post. There are numerous books that I want to read in the upcoming months, but it seems that I can never get around to them. Sometimes I feel that I am being too ambitious and trying to read books that are too weighty for this time in my life, when I have a lot of things going on. But I think I will get around to reading Cormac McCarthy’s [_The Road_.](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/XThe+Road&SORT=D/XThe+Road&SORT=D&SUBKEY=The%20Road/51%2C2671%2C2671%2CE/frameset&FF=XThe+Road&SORT=D&85%2C85%2C) I have heard generally good things about this book, and it seems to be very popular for a work of ‘literary fiction.’ It has been made in to a movie starring [Viggo Mortensen ](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001557/)that will premiere at [Cannes ](http://www.festival-cannes.com/en.html)in May. Before I see that film I will try to read this book and try not to picture Viggo Mortensen as the main character. Perhaps this will add another dimension of difficulty to the book. 




I also want to get around to reading, at least partly, some of [Pauline Kael’s ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~/a?a)writings in her various collections of Film Criticism. _Trash, Art and the Movies_ is her most famous essay; I don’t think I’ve ever gotten around to reading all thirty-something pages. I would like to read [_The Citizen Kane Book: Raising Kane_, ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/XPauline+Kael&SORT=D/XPauline+Kael&SORT=D&SUBKEY=Pauline%20Kael/1%2C16%2C16%2CE/frameset&FF=XPauline+Kael&SORT=D&8%2C8%2C)where she argues that Orson Welles deserves more credit than is necessary for revolutionizing cinema with _[Citizen Kane](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/)_, and even in the creation of certain aspects of the movie itself. I have read with interest other writings by Pauline Kael that I’ve read (what fan of movies hasn’t?) and feel the need to dig in to more. 




But I need some recommendations as well. What are other good books that Snell Library has which are worth reading? What about movies? What is a good summer read. i.e something that is sort of silly but interesting? I still have two and a half more months in Boston (before I go to New York for a spell) and still need to spend some time in the Snell stacks.
