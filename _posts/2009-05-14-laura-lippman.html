This spring, Laura Lippman spoke at the Library. In preparation, I read most of her books, and <em>really </em>enjoyed them. They're mysteries, which is a genre I love. (Though in some ways they grow increasingly serious, and I think could be appreciated by a non-mystery fan.) Her first is <em><a title="NU cat Baltimore Blues" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/cPS3562.I586+B3+1997/cps+3562+i586+b3+1997/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=cps+3562+i586+b3+1997&amp;1%2C1%2C" target="_blank">Baltimore Blues</a></em>. I think that my favorite was <a title="Sugar House" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/tsugar+house/tsugar+house/1%2C2%2C2%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=tsugar+house+a+tess+monaghan+mystery&amp;1%2C1%2C/indexsort=-" target="_blank"><em>The Sugar House</em></a><em>,</em> but it's hard to pick one. Snell Library has most of her books, including her latest, <em><a title="life sentences" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/tlife+sentences/tlife+sentences/1%2C4%2C8%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=tlife+sentences&amp;4%2C%2C4/indexsort=-" target="_blank">Life Sentences</a></em>, which she discussed when she spoke in March:
