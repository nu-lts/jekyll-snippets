One of our most successful panels here at the NU Libraries was the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/libraries_and_collections/libraries/calendar_of_events/free_culture_forum/">Free Culture Forum</a> in March 2006, sparked by student interest, and featuring Lawrence Lessig of Creative Commons fame.  He's now left Creative Commons to work in DC on a campaign for congressional reform (called <em>Change Congress</em>).  <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080616/hayes" target="_blank">The Nation recently published an article on Lessig</a> and this act of his career.   However on his web site he claims the work he was planning for "Change Congress" turned out to be beyond what a single academic could do, so he will be moving from Stanford, his previous academic base, to the <a href="http://www.ethics.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Safra Center for Ethics</a> at Harvard University, where he will apparently be pursuing a five year initiative on understanding the role of money in corrupting the public trust.    So maybe we'll have more chances to hear him speak again, now that he's local!
