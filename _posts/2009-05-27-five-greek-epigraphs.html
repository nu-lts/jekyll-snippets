My husband recently finished writing a book about foreign policy.  Just as it was about to go to press, he hit a snag: he had started each chapter with an epigraph, a short quotation, from the ancient Greek historian Thucydides.  Now, you would think that anyone who wrote 2,500 years ago would be out of copyright and could be quoted freely, and you would be right, BUT...the owner of the English translation that my husband was using wanted $150 for <em>each quotation, </em>or 750 clams total.  My husband could translate Thucydides himself but doesn't feel terribly confident of his own ancient Greek skills, although he knows Greek "a little."

Luckily, there is a translation that's in the public domain, which means it can be freely copied and quoted.  It's in the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu" target="_blank">Perseus Digital Library,</a> a web site with a wealth of primary and secondary source information on the ancient world.   So this is a grateful shoutout to the people behind Perseus: <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/about/who/gregoryCrane" target="_blank">Greg Crane</a> and <a href="http://www.tufts.edu" target="_blank">Tufts University</a>.   I'm in awe of this amazing example of scholarly publishing at its best!

Are you looking for advice about using someone else's work in your own scholarship?  Ask your <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/subject_specialists/" target="_blank">subject librarian</a> at the NU Libraries for assistance.  Maybe there's a resource like Perseus for you, too!
