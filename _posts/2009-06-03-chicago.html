<p style="margin: 0pt;">Over the weekend, I visited Chicago for the first time, to attend a friend's wedding.  It was a good trip, but a <img style="float: left; margin: 10px;" src="https://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&amp;Password=neuniv&amp;Return=T&amp;type=L&amp;Value=0375725601%20(pbk)%20:&amp;Options=Y" alt="" width="151" height="186" />very busy time.  While I saw a lot of the city and surrounding area, there were still some sights that I wasn't able to see.  I've read <a title="NUCat record" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xdevil+in+the+white+city&amp;SORT=D/Xdevil+in+the+white+city&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=devil%20in%20the%20white%20city/1%2C3%2C3%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xdevil+in+the+white+city&amp;SORT=D&amp;1%2C1%2C " target="_blank"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Devil in the White City</em> by Erik Larson</a>, and while I know there's not much left in terms of the fair site, I had wanted to see more of the city that dealt with that part of its<img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="https://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&amp;Password=neuniv&amp;Return=T&amp;type=L&amp;Value=0590472674%20:&amp;Options=Y" alt="" width="151" height="137" /> history.  I did manage to take an architecture boat tour, where I heard more about Daniel Burnham and John Root.  Also, the architecture in the city is really grand-in addition to skyscrapers, there are many great Art Deco buildings.  Our guide also mentioned that a several buildings had recently been filmed as part of Gotham City in <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Dark Knight</em>.  The trip also made me want to pick up a few books on the <a title="nucat" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13/?searchtype=d&amp;searcharg=chicago+fire&amp;searchscope=13&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=1&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=Xchicago+fire%26SORT%3DDZ" target="_blank">Chicago Fire of 1871</a>.</p>
