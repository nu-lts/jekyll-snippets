<em>The Boston Globe</em> has published a list of what they think are the <a href="http://www.boston.com/globe/bestofnewengland/books/?sort=ranking&amp;p1=Well_MostPop_Emailed1" target="_blank">100 Essential New England Books</a>.  There are certainly a number on the list that I've read or certainly been meaning to read.  I'd also be curious to see what determined their rankings.  They left off one of my New England favorites, <em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xwitch+of+blackbird&amp;SORT=D/Xwitch+of+blackbird&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=witch%20of%20blackbird/1%2C3%2C3%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xwitch+of+blackbird&amp;SORT=D&amp;1%2C1%2C" target="_blank">The Witch of Blackbird Pond</a></em>.  I have a feeling, I may come up with a few more, once I have a chance to mull it over.

What do you think?
