One of my favorite places to just poke around in the library is the Favat Children's section. I love children's books - at one point I even thought I wanted to major in it, if that was in any way possible - and strolling through those couple of aisles, always give me a very nice, private, unthreatening sensation of calm.

It's always nice getting new things, but equally delightful finding old children's books that I had forgotten, some little piece that I'd picked up years and years ago in the corner of my elementary or middle or highÂ school teacher's classroom, in a town far, far away from here.

Today I found <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/ablock%2C+francesca/ablock+francesca/1%2C1%2C8%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=ablock+francesca+lia&amp;5%2C%2C8">The Rose and the Beast: Fairy Tales Retold by Francesca Lia Block</a>. Years ago, it immediately attracted me probably from a combination of my children's books/fairy tales/myths love and a lurking interest in dark stories and things and images - things that made me worship Tim Burton as a kid. These fairy tales are odd reimaginings of classic stories from the beautifully twisted, darkly poetic mind of Francesca Lia Block. They're a jaded adult in the body of a girl-child, a tea party of the most tired experiences in a woman's lifetime, a band of teen hoodlums getting drunk in the kid's theater house they just broke into, sugar icing on a rotten cupcake - melancholy, and ironic, and sad in the sharpest way.
