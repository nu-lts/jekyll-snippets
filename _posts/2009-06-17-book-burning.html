I saw this article on book burning that I thought might be of interest <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2009/06/16/francesca_lia_block/index.html" target="_blank">("A teen book burns at the stake").  </a>A group of citizens in West Bend, Wisconsin has been trying to remove <em>Baby Be-Bop </em>from the shelves of their public library.  When the Library Board decided not to comply with their request, it looks like several members of the board were ousted.  Another group, the Christian Civil Liberties Union, has filed a lawsuit against the town and library, and have called for the book to be publically burned. The author in question, Francesca Lia Block, is actually one <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/index.php?p=257" target="_self">Natalie had mentioned earlier</a>.
