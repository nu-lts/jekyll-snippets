Debbie Pennino directed me towards another book list, by <em>Newsweek</em> on "<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/204300/page/1" target="_blank">50 Books for Our Times</a>."  It certainly gave me a few more ideas for books to pick up.  I was a bit disappointed by how few female authors they included; it looked like less than 15%.  But on the list was <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/index.php?p=85" target="_blank">Snell Library favorite Geraldine Brooks</a> and Pat Barker's Regeneration trilogy, which I'm currently finishing up, and would strongly suggest.  You can pick up all <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/aBarker,+Pat./abarker+pat/-3,-1,0,E/2exact&amp;FF=abarker+pat&amp;1,8," target="_blank">three volumes</a> at Snell!
