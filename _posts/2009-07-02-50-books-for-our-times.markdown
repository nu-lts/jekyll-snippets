Debbie Pennino directed me towards another book list, by _Newsweek_ on "[50 Books for Our Times](http://www.newsweek.com/id/204300/page/1)."  It certainly gave me a few more ideas for books to pick up.  I was a bit disappointed by how few female authors they included; it looked like less than 15%.  But on the list was [Snell Library favorite Geraldine Brooks](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/index.php?p=85) and Pat Barker's Regeneration trilogy, which I'm currently finishing up, and would strongly suggest.  You can pick up all [three volumes](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/aBarker,+Pat./abarker+pat/-3,-1,0,E/2exact&FF=abarker+pat&1,8,) at Snell!
