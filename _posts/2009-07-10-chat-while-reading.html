We've often discussed the future of books and reading on Snell Snippets, so I thought that some might be interested in this <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106150832" target="_blank">"Chat While Reading: The Future of Books?"</a> article from NPR.  Their article focuses on <a href="http://www.bookglutton.com/" target="_blank">BookGlutton.com</a> but a number of commenters mentioned other communal reading sites like <a href="http://www.librarything.com/" target="_blank">LibraryThing.com</a>.  How do you think a site like this would function differently for classes than a Blackboard chat or discussion page?  Currently, if I have a friend who lives too far away, we'll just email back and forth about books we're reading: quoting passages, etc.  Just this past week, a friend who lives in New Zealand and I were emailing back and forth as she finished up <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xanna+karenina&amp;SORT=D/Xanna+karenina&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=anna%20karenina/1%2C25%2C25%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xanna+karenina&amp;SORT=D&amp;2%2C2%2C" target="_blank">Anna Karenina</a>. I think for now I'm going to stick with that more private way of communication and dialogue.  But I also often like to check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/">metacritic</a>  or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> after I read or watch something, to get a sense of its reception and other people's reactions.  Any thoughts?
