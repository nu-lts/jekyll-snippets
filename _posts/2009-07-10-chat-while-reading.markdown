We've often discussed the future of books and reading on Snell Snippets, so I thought that some might be interested in this ["Chat While Reading: The Future of Books?"](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106150832) article from NPR.  Their article focuses on [BookGlutton.com](http://www.bookglutton.com/) but a number of commenters mentioned other communal reading sites like [LibraryThing.com](http://www.librarything.com/).  How do you think a site like this would function differently for classes than a Blackboard chat or discussion page?  Currently, if I have a friend who lives too far away, we'll just email back and forth about books we're reading: quoting passages, etc.  Just this past week, a friend who lives in New Zealand and I were emailing back and forth as she finished up [Anna Karenina](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xanna+karenina&SORT=D/Xanna+karenina&SORT=D&SUBKEY=anna%20karenina/1%2C25%2C25%2CE/frameset&FF=Xanna+karenina&SORT=D&2%2C2%2C). I think for now I'm going to stick with that more private way of communication and dialogue.  But I also often like to check out [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/), [metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/)  or [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) after I read or watch something, to get a sense of its reception and other people's reactions.  Any thoughts?
