This is my first post.  So, hello.  I'm Ethan.  I work as an Administrative Assistant in the Dean's Office of the Library.  When I'm not working, I am also a graduate student at the Simmons College Graduate School of Library and Information Science.  Most of my blog posts will likely relate to what I am learning in school.

The issue of how people receive and use information is a hot topic in the Library/Information Science community.  It is with this topic in mind that I stumbled upon a blog post from the New York Times culture blog <a title="Christie's Offers Its Own iPhone App" href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/christies-offers-its-own-iphone-app/">ArtsBeat.</a> It seems that the auction house<a title="Christie's Guide to Collecting" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xchristies&amp;SORT=D/Xchristies&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=christies/1%2C12%2C12%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xchristies&amp;SORT=D&amp;1%2C1%2C" target="_blank"> Christie's</a> has created an iPhone app that allows users to browse their collections.  I won't go into too much detail but I would recommend reading the article.  Fortunately, people now have access to <a title="Christie's Lot  168/ Sale 5909" href="http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5225642&amp;sid=1731406c-ae90-468a-a550-ddda95caaa8a" target="_blank">Gucci hand bags</a>, with a starting bid of $4,086, in the palm of their hand.
