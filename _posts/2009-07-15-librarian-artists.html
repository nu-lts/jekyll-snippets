Reading this month's <a href="http://www.luckymag.com/" target="_blank"><em>Lucky</em> magazine</a>, I was excited to read about featured
<blockquote>New York artist Roz Leibowitz [who] draws impossibly intricate sketches with nothing more than a pencil and an antique sheet of paper, which the former librarian pulls from her collection of 18<sup>th</sup>- and 19<sup>th</sup>-century ephemera.</blockquote>
I took a look at some of her other works at the <a href="http://searspeyton.com/html/artistresults.asp?type=ALL">Sears-Peyton gallery</a>, and thought they were interesting, gothic pieces.   I liked the idea of a librarian-artist re-using found papers.  I think my favorite is <em><a href="http://searspeyton.com/html/Detail.asp?WorkInvNum=20055&amp;whatpage=artist" target="_blank">The Blizzard</a></em>.  What's yours?  And do you have any other favorite librarian-artists?
