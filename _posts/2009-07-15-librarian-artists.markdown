Reading this month's [_Lucky_ magazine](http://www.luckymag.com/), I was excited to read about featured


> New York artist Roz Leibowitz [who] draws impossibly intricate sketches with nothing more than a pencil and an antique sheet of paper, which the former librarian pulls from her collection of 18th- and 19th-century ephemera.


I took a look at some of her other works at the [Sears-Peyton gallery](http://searspeyton.com/html/artistresults.asp?type=ALL), and thought they were interesting, gothic pieces.   I liked the idea of a librarian-artist re-using found papers.  I think my favorite is _[The Blizzard](http://searspeyton.com/html/Detail.asp?WorkInvNum=20055&whatpage=artist)_.  What's yours?  And do you have any other favorite librarian-artists?
