It is delightful to spread the word that Northeastern University Libraries now has a blog (you've got it, right here!), with a talented team of bloggers.  These bloggers aim to share with you insightful ponderings about information and society, digitial initiatives, leadership in libraries, research sources, reading picks, and much more.  We also want to hear from you!  Please join us in this online conversation.  So, watch this space!

Be well and go well, Maria Carpenter, Northeastern University Libraries
