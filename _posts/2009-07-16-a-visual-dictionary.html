Graphic designers are always trying to think of ways to visually communicate to the public effectively. Hence when I stumbled across an article while reading <a href="http://www.huntington-news.com/inside/a-photo-is-worth-one-single-word-1.1774110" target="_blank"><em>the Huntington News</em> </a>this morning, I was intrigued. Lindley Warren, an Iowa native who currently resides in Amsterdam, thought up the idea of <a href="http://thephotographicdictionary.org/home.html" target="_blank">"The Photographic Dictionary"</a>. On this site, people regularly send her photos of everything and anything that depict a word in the dictionary, ranging from colors to emotions to everyday objects. After browsing through many of the photographs, it is quite interesting to see what different people's perceptions of the world are :).
