Not a beach person? The <a href="http://www.decordova.org/">DeCordova Museum</a> in Lincoln, MA is an enjoyable summer  destination. The current exhibit, "The Old Weird America" offers multimedia off-beat interactive interpertations of historical facts, figures, events and culture.  Though Kara Walker's animated, shadow-puppet video, "8 Possible Beginnings or: The Creation of African-America, a Moving Picture,"  is deemed not suitable for children
