	<li>Daniel Clancy, Engineering Director, Google Books</li>
	<li>John Palfrey, Henry N. Ess III Professor of Law and Vice Dean for Library and Information Resources, Harvard Law School</li>

<p class="middlep">Google Book Search is an ambitious project to digitize the world's books. Six years, many million works, and two U.S. lawsuits later, the project is now set to change dramatically. Google has reached a settlement agreement with authors and publishers that, if approved by the court, will have sweeping implications for writers, readers, scholars, librarians, and the public at large.</p>
<p class="lastp">The panel of speakers will explain and discuss the settlement. The panel will be followed by a question-and-answer session.</p>
