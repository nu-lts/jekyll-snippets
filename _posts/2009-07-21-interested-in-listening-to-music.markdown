While the Library has a number of [different academic resources](http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/for_students/), some can be enjoyed for non-academic reasons too.  I think the [Naxos Music Library](http://0-neu.naxosmusiclibrary.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/homepage.asp) is a good example of this.  Even out side of music, history and art classes, you can take pleasure in listening to over 85,000 tracks while studying.  As a bonus, it is a resource also available to our alumni users.  You can search by genres such as Classical, Jazz, Pop and Rock, World, and even Relaxation Music.  I think one of my favorites is [Ravel’s Bolero](http://0-neu.naxosmusiclibrary.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/catalogue/item.asp?cid=PTC5186058).  Try searching and see what you find!
