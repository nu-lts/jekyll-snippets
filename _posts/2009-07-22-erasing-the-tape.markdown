![Buzz Aldrin on the moon](http://www.omegawatches.com/uploads/pics/img_apollo11_01.jpg)

[Yes, Rebecca, I remember it!](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/index.php?p=254) I was a little tyke at the time, but my parents woke me up and put me in front of the TV to see Neil Armstrong walking on the moon. They knew it was historic, Armstrong knew it was historic, the TV broadcasters knew it was historic.

So you would think someone at NASA would have thought to put a sticky note or "Don't erase this" in red marker on that moon landing videotape, right? But, apparently...not. So the original video of the moon landing, according to NASA, was probably taped over in the 1970s.

Fast forward to the 40-year anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission and sure enough, [NASA has spent over $200,000 ](http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_12852368?source=most_viewed)restoring and "enhancing" television video copies of the moon landing with the help of a Hollywood film company. On the plus side, apparently the picture quality is better than the TV. [You can compare them](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/videogallery/index.html) on the NASA web site.

I've been thinking about the whole cost-benefit of preservation in the context of our [Archives and Special Collections department](http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives), which is preserving and digitizing [NU's history and local Boston history, too](http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/collections), hopefully more diligently than NASA! After all, does anyone here have 200 grand to spend restoring our stuff?
