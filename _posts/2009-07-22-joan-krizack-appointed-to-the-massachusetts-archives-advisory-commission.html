We're very please to announce that Joan Krizack, <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/">University Archivist and Head, Special Collections</a> for Northeastern University Libraries, was appointed by Secretary of the Commonwealth, William Galvin, to the <a href="http://www.sec.state.ma.us/arc/arcidx.htm">Massachusetts Archives Advisory Commission</a>.  

The Archives Advisory Commission was established in the mid 1970's as the central advisory body for historical records planning for the state.  The Commission is mandated to advise the Secretary on archival matters and establish, with the Archivist of the Commonwealth, a comprehensive statewide documentary preservation plan. Acting as the central advisory body for historical records planning, the Archives Advisory Commission served as the model for the National Archives when it established a State Historical Records Advisory Board in every state.

They have a number of online exhibits, and from one entitled <a href="http://www.sec.state.ma.us/mus/exhibits/onlineexhibits/acadianonline/acaidx3.htm"><em>Le Grande Derangement,</em> </a>I learned that in 1755 10,000 French Canadians were exiled from Nova Scotia, and 1,000 of them ended up as refugees in Massachusetts. As these ‘Acadians' did not pledge allegiance to the British Crown, they were compelled to remain until the end of the French and Indian War in 1763.  At that time most tried to relocate to other French regions where they shared a language and religion-France, Quebec and Haiti, along with Louisiana.  It's an interesting interment history that I knew nothing about until discovering the exhibit.  Apparently, Longfellow also wrote a related poem titled <em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xevangeline&amp;SORT=D/Xevangeline&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=evangeline/1%2C35%2C35%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xevangeline&amp;SORT=D&amp;6%2C6%2C ">Evangeline</a>,</em> about lovers separated during the conflict, that later served as the basis for a movie starring Dolores del Rio!
