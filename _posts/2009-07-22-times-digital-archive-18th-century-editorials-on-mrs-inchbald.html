The <a href="http://0-find.galegroup.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/menu/start?prod=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=mlin_b_northest"><span style="bold;">Times Digital Archive</span></a> is exactly what it sounds like: an archive of the London Times from 1785 to 1985, unfortunately not including the Sunday edition.   It has wide coverage of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, including the height of the British colonial period, with applicability for most research in history, literary, women's, and postcolonial studies.  It can also be used to find reviews of authors' works <a href="http://0-infotrac.galegroup.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/itw/infomark/792/591/33556154w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS50595195&amp;dyn=44!xrn_2_0_CS50595195&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=mlin_b_northest" target="_blank">as published during their lifetime</a>.  When searching, though, remember, that the further back you go in time, the more issues you might have with language and differences in both spelling and typography.
