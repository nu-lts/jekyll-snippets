_**[BuildingGreen Suite](http://0-www.buildinggreen.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/index.cfm)**_, is a resource you can try out via the Library until Oct 10.  If you want to take a look, you'll find articles, reviews, and news stories covering energy-efficient, resource-efficient, and healthy building practices. We also look forward to your [feedback!](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/evaluation/)

BuildingGreen Suite,  updated monthly, offers full access to BuildingGreen.com, a key source of information about improving environmental performance. It also includes information on a wide range of topics related to sustainable building, including energy efficiency, recycled-content materials, land-use planning and indoor air quality.

The _**BuildingGreen Suite**_ brings together material from _**Environmental Building News (EBN)**_ since 1992, product listings from the _**GreenSpec**_ products directory, and a database of project case studies from the _**High-Performance Buildings Database**_.
