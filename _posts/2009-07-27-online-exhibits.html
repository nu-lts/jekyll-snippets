<img class="alignleft" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" src="https://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&amp;Password=neuniv&amp;Return=T&amp;type=L&amp;Value=019506237X%20(acid-free%20paper)&amp;Options=Y" alt="" width="324" height="551" />We're working on creating a new template for online exhibits for the Library.  As part of the process, I've been looking at a number of online exhibits, and found the subject matter of <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/exhibits/RLCexhibit/shes/she_is_morems.html">"She is More to be Pitied than Censured"</a> at Brown University to be particularly interesting.  The <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13/?searchtype=X&amp;searcharg=mary+rogers&amp;searchscope=13&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=1&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=Xbeecher-tilton%26SORT%3DD">case of Mary Rogers</a> reminded me of the young women lured to the big city, that Erik Larson so expertly describes in <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/index.php?p=253"><em>The Devil in the White City</em> </a>.  H. H. Holmes would also prey on similar young women who traveled to Chicago.  The Brown exhibit highlights a number of cases, including many that took place in Massachusetts and throughout New England.  It also deals with <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13/?searchtype=X&amp;searcharg=beecher-tilton&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=D&amp;extended=1&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=abeecher-tilton">the Beecher-Tilton scandal</a>, in which <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/astowe/astowe/1%2C88%2C165%2CE/2exact&amp;FF=astowe+harriet+beecher+1811+1896&amp;1%2C55%2C/indexsort=-">Harriet Beecher Stowe's </a>brother was accused of adultery.  The exhibit is organized around the 1894 song "She is More to be Pitied than Censured" by William B. Gray.  I was able to find <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/MargueriteNewton">an old recording of the song </a>by Marguerite Newton at the Internet Archive!
