H. Holmes would also prey on similar young women who traveled to Chicago.  The Brown exhibit highlights a number of cases, including many that took place in Massachusetts and throughout New England.  It also deals with [the Beecher-Tilton scandal](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13/?searchtype=X&searcharg=beecher-tilton&searchscope=13&SORT=D&extended=1&SUBMIT=Search&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=abeecher-tilton), in which [Harriet Beecher Stowe's ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/astowe/astowe/1%2C88%2C165%2CE/2exact&FF=astowe+harriet+beecher+1811+1896&1%2C55%2C/indexsort=-)brother was accused of adultery.  The exhibit is organized around the 1894 song "She is More to be Pitied than Censured" by William B. Gray.  I was able to find [an old recording of the song ](http://www.archive.org/details/MargueriteNewton)by Marguerite Newton at the Internet Archive!
