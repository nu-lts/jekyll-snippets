Here at Snell Library we're about to launch a redesigned home page! A library committee did surveys and testing with NU faculty, students, and staff, with the goal of making the site more user-friendly. On the new version you'll find:



	
  * Front-and-center research tools

	
  * Streamlined, easier-to-use visual design

	
  * Quick access to course reserves, interlibrary loan, and other frequently-used services

	
  * A Multi-Search box, right on the front page, that lets you search multiple databases at once


We tried to make our research tools the central focus of the site -- you should be able to locate ejournals and databases easily, as well as popular services. You'll also find easy access to research guides, developed by our subject librarians, to help you find the most important resources in your academic discipline.

You'll still find up-to-date library news and info on our events, and we've added links to this blog and our Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube sites.

We thank everyone who has provided feedback so far, and we'd love to hear from more of you. Go to our page at [http://www.lib.neu.edu](http://www.lib.neu.edu) to see a sneak preview, try out the new site, and offer your comments!
