Very interesting <a title="link to Boston.com article" href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/08/04/john_quincy_adams_tweeting_thanks_to_mass_society/" target="_blank">article on Boston.com</a> today about John Quincy Adams's very short diary entries and how closely they resemble "tweets," the 140-character posts on <a title="go to Twitter" href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. Now the Massachusetts Historical Society will be posting his line-a-day entries as tweets exactly 200 years later, starting tomorrow with the first entry of his trip to Russia that began August 5, 1809. You can follow John Quincy Adams on Twitter -- his handle is <a title="Twitter feed" href="http://twitter.com/JQAdams_MHS" target="_blank">JQAdams_MHS</a>. What a great way to bring history alive!
