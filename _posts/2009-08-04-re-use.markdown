We all know we should recycle, but what about products that can't be placed in the recycling bin? Are there ways to re-use some of these products? [AltUse](http://www.altuse.com/) attempts to help you do just that, with its user-submitted suggestions for re-using everyday products. A quick look at fabric softener sheets tells me that there are 8 ways to use them that have been submitted.

The interface is clunky, but the idea is good. And you can rate the use idea for theÂ product. It's worth a look, and can perhaps help you save money and the environment.
