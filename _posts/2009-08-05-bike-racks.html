Have I been walking into the library with my eyes shut, or are there many new bike racks all around the library? I feel certain I didn't see them yesterday. I know many people who bike to campus, and I'm sure the additional racks for locking up are a welcome addition. It's exciting to see these changes, and I do hope they will be well-used!
