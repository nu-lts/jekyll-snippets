As [Stephanie reported](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/index.php?p=195) las![](https://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&Password=neuniv&Return=T&type=L&Value=014071474X&Options=Y )t year, if you're a Shakespeare or outdoor theater fan, you'll want to be sure to check out this summer's performance of _The Comedy of Errors _on Boston Common.  If you like you can [brush up on the play](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xcomedy+of+errors&SORT=D/Xcomedy+of+errors&SORT=D&SUBKEY=comedy%20of%20errors/1%2C30%2C30%2CE/frameset&FF=Xcomedy+of+errors&SORT=D&1%2C1%2C) ahead of time by checking out one of Snell's copies.  _The_ _Boston Globe_ ran an [article](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/08/02/forget_that_high_school_class_shakespeare_outdoors_a_midsummer_nights_dream/) recently on the popularity of outdoor summer Shakespeare performances in the US. They also covered [some background](http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2009/03/17/season_of_renewal_for_shakespeare_on_the_common/ ) to the production and the [Commonwealth Shakespeare Company](http://www.commshakes.org/) earlier this year. _The Comedy of Errors_ is playing now through August 16, so take a picnic and enjoy it while you can!  _ _
