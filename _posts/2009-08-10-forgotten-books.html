<a href="http://www.forgottenbooks.org/catalog" target="_blank">Forgotten Books</a> is an on-line library of books that you can read on-line for free. They are hosted by Google. The titles are listed alphabetically. The collection has 1736 books on-line. However, almost half are unreadable due to some hosting error. But in any case this is an interesting example of what books on-line look like.
