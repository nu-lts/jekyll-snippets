I enjoyed this Inside Higher Ed article on "[Publishing Genius](http://www.insidehighered.com/views/mclemee/mclemee254)" on Adam Robinson's [publishing imprint](http://www.publishinggenius.com/) in Baltimore, MD.  It sounds like he's found success by publishing untraditionally--producing digital versions, or putting up "broadside" pages around Baltimore.  Even though I've never visited the city, I've had a soft spot for literary Baltimore since reading [Laura Lippman's books](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/aLippman,+Laura,+1959-/alippman+laura+1959/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/2exact&FF=alippman+laura+1959&1%2C10%2C), which mention hometown luminaries such as [James M. Cain](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/acain%2C+jame/acain+jame/1%2C3%2C16%2CE/2exact&FF=acain+james+m+james+mallahan+1892+1977&1%2C14%2C/indexsort=-), [Edgar Allen Poe](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13/a?Poe%2C+Edgar+Allan%2C+1809-1849&search_code=a) and [H.L. Mencken](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/amencken/amencken/1%2C3%2C46%2CE/2exact&FF=amencken+h+l+henry+louis+1880+1956&1%2C44%2C/indexsort=-).
