I recently read an interesting post on William Golding and <a title="LOTF" href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xlord+of+the+flies&amp;SORT=D/Xlord+of+the+flies&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=lord%20of%20the%20flies/1%2C15%2C15%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xlord+of+the+flies&amp;SORT=D&amp;3%2C3%2C" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Flies</em></a> that I wanted to <a title="Double XX" href="http://www.doublex.com/conversation/William%20Golding%27s%20sexual%20history" target="_blank">share</a>.  (As a warning, the post gives away part of the book's ending.)  A new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571231632?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=dblx-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0571231632" target="_blank">biography</a> by John Carey details Golding's rather unpleasant personal history, including his attempted rape of a 15 year-old girl when he was 18.  I never had to read the <em>Lord of the Flies </em>for school, and last year I added it to <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/index.php?p=81" target="_blank">my TBR list</a> (as an alternate selection).  I tried reading it, but like Kim, couldn't really get into it.  I read the first quarter of the book and don't see its appeal, but I know enough people who recommend it that maybe I'll need to give it another chance in the future. I think that there's no harm in discussing an author's biography (though fourth grade seems awfully young to delve into either the themes of the book or Golding), but I often found that diving into an author's history (whether heroic or unsavory), paled in comparison to discussing the dramas of the story itself. What do you think? About William Golding, <em>Lord of the Flies</em>, or learning more about the cruel parts of an author's (or artist's, or historical figure's) past?
