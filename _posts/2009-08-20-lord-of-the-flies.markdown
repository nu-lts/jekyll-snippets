I recently read an interesting post on William Golding and [_Lord of the Flies_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xlord+of+the+flies&SORT=D/Xlord+of+the+flies&SORT=D&SUBKEY=lord%20of%20the%20flies/1%2C15%2C15%2CE/frameset&FF=Xlord+of+the+flies&SORT=D&3%2C3%2C) that I wanted to [share](http://www.doublex.com/conversation/William%20Golding%27s%20sexual%20history).  (As a warning, the post gives away part of the book's ending.)  A new [biography](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571231632?ie=UTF8&tag=dblx-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0571231632) by John Carey details Golding's rather unpleasant personal history, including his attempted rape of a 15 year-old girl when he was 18.  I never had to read the _Lord of the Flies _for school, and last year I added it to [my TBR list](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/index.php?p=81) (as an alternate selection).  I tried reading it, but like Kim, couldn't really get into it.  I read the first quarter of the book and don't see its appeal, but I know enough people who recommend it that maybe I'll need to give it another chance in the future. I think that there's no harm in discussing an author's biography (though fourth grade seems awfully young to delve into either the themes of the book or Golding), but I often found that diving into an author's history (whether heroic or unsavory), paled in comparison to discussing the dramas of the story itself. What do you think? About William Golding, _Lord of the Flies_, or learning more about the cruel parts of an author's (or artist's, or historical figure's) past?
