If you're looking for something fun (and free!) to do this weekend, go check out <a href="http://www.bostongreenfest.org/speakersworkshops.html" target="_blank">Boston GreenFest 2009</a> at City Hall Plaza, right outside the Government Center T stop. This event runs from 10 AM to 10 PM August 21st and 22nd with a <a title="Concert lineup" href="http://www.bostongreenfest.org/performanceschedule.html">kickoff concert</a> tonight from 5 to 10.

Over the next two days there will be screenings of the <a title="Schedule and descriptions" href="http://www.bostongreenfest.org/filmfest.html">films</a> "The Greening of Southie", "Fresh", "Out of Balance: ExxonMobil's Impact on Climate Change", and "Flow: The Film". There will be <a title="Schedule" href="http://www.bostongreenfest.org/speakersworkshops.html" target="_blank">speakers and workshops</a> covering everything from green cars to eco-games to the Charles River. You can also walk around and check out the <a href="http://www.bostongreenfest.org/artgallery.html" target="_blank">art gallery</a>, <a href="http://www.bostongreenfest.org/exhibitors.html" target="_blank">exhibits</a> and listen to some live music.

This looks like a really fun event with something for everyone. I'm planning to attend on Saturday so maybe I'll see you there.
