If you're looking for something fun (and free!) to do this weekend, go check out [Boston GreenFest 2009](http://www.bostongreenfest.org/speakersworkshops.html) at City Hall Plaza, right outside the Government Center T stop. This event runs from 10 AM to 10 PM August 21st and 22nd with a [kickoff concert](http://www.bostongreenfest.org/performanceschedule.html) tonight from 5 to 10.

Over the next two days there will be screenings of the [films](http://www.bostongreenfest.org/filmfest.html) "The Greening of Southie", "Fresh", "Out of Balance: ExxonMobil's Impact on Climate Change", and "Flow: The Film". There will be [speakers and workshops](http://www.bostongreenfest.org/speakersworkshops.html) covering everything from green cars to eco-games to the Charles River. You can also walk around and check out the [art gallery](http://www.bostongreenfest.org/artgallery.html), [exhibits](http://www.bostongreenfest.org/exhibitors.html) and listen to some live music.

This looks like a really fun event with something for everyone. I'm planning to attend on Saturday so maybe I'll see you there.
