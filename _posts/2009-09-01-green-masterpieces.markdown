On Wednesday, September 2nd the [Boston Landmarks Orchestra](http://www.landmarksorchestra.org/index.php) will present ["Green Masterpieces"](http://www.landmarksorchestra.org/concertsdetails.php?id=102), a free concert at the [Hatch Shell](http://www.celebrateboston.com/events/hatch-shell.htm) on the Esplanade. The concert, which begins at 7:00 PM will feature nature-themed pieces by Mendelssohn, Mozart, Handel and others. NU's very own [Michael Dukakis](http://www.northeastern.edu/dukakiscenter/) will be narrating _The Story of Frederick Law Olmsted _by Thomas Oboe Lee. This will be a [carbon-neutral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality) concert because all emissions generated by it will be offset. The Hatch Shell is just a short walk from the Green Line's Arlington stop.
