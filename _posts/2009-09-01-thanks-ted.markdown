I've enjoyed seeing the "Thanks, Ted!" signs on the expressway over the past few days, reminding  us to reflect on the contributions Kennedy made to Massachusetts's infrastructure.  Of course, it's not all about roads!  Kennedy was instrumental in helping NU get funding for numerous projects, and you can learn about [his contribution to the federal student aid program](http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/Kennedy/index.htm) in an online exhibit created by our own Archives and Special Collections staff, in honor of Kennedy's visit to NU in March, 2008.  I was a beneficiary of that program myself...So, thanks, Ted, for helping me get a college education!
