![](https://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&Password=neuniv&Return=T&type=L&Value=0792840461&Options=Y)I just watched [_The Thomas Crown Affair _](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~/a?searchtype=X&searcharg=thomas+crown+affair&SORT=D&image.x=0&image.y=0)on Monday (the 1968 Norman Jewison version), which landed on two stylish films lists recently ([LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/features/image/la-ig-movies21-2008dec21-pg,0,1862682.photogallery) and [Turner Classic Movies](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2009/09/turner-classic-movies-favorite-fashion-films.html )).  Sleek women like [Lauren Santo Domingo](http://www.style.com/peopleparties/celebritysearch/person1113) refer to it as their sartorial inspiration. But I didn't realize that it was [set and filmed in Boston](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063688/locations)-it's cool to see popular sites like the State House, Beacon Hill, Boston Common, Mt. Auburn Cemetary, and [Crane's Beach](http://www.thetrustees.org/places-to-visit/northeast-ma/crane-beach-on-the-crane.html), among others.  It's also available at Snell, so you can rent it and pick out your own favorite location (or outfit).   I think mine are their stroll by the Charles River, the Polo Scene at Myopia Hunt Club, [Steve McQueen's riding outfit](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm524720128/tt0063688), and [Faye Dunaway's dress](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm645109760/tt0063688).
