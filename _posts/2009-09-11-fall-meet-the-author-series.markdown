This novel focuses on five generations of Afro-Puerto Rican women from the mid-1800s to the present. The story takes place in Africa and follows Fela and her husband, who perform a tribal ceremony, pouring the essence of their unborn child into a stone. The couple is then separated by slavery. Throughout the next four generations, the power of this stone is revealed.

**_"This is a remarkable first novel, both magical and deeply real, that vividly renders the power of storytelling to a diasporic people. The story of each woman in her own time and place is like a luminous fiber, meticulously spun from hay into gold, which woven together creates an unforgettable history, grounded in a black stone that symbolizes the legends and rituals of the Old Ones, but spiraling into a wider world that connects stone to memory and earth to continents...I could not resist the magnetic pull of these stories."_**_-Alicia Gaspar de Alba, author of _Calligraphy of the Witch

**Author Christos Papadimitriou**

**Wednesday, October 28 @ Noon**

**90 Snell Library**

** **

This beautiful graphic novel tells the true story of Bertrand Russell, British logician, anti-war activist, and Nobel Prize winner, and his colleagues in the fields of math, science, and philosophy. It is set against the historical backdrop of major twentieth century events, including the two World Wars, and explores Russell's passionate quest for mathematical truth.

**"_Some superheroes leap tall buildings with a single bound. Others catch thieves just like flies. But the ones in Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos H. Papadimitriou's graphic novel just think-really hard-about an incredibly difficult dilemma...Like all the best superheroes, they are deeply, fascinatingly flawed characters."_**_-_Financial Times

**_"This is an extraordinary graphic novel, wildly ambitious in daring to put into words and drawings the life and thought of one of the greatest philosophers of the last century, Bertrand Russell...A rare intellectual and artistic achievement, which will, I'm sure, lead its readers to explore realms of knowledge they thought were forbidden to them."_**_-Howard Zinn, author of _A People's History of the United States

Sponsored by Northeastern University Libraries and the Northeastern Bookstore.

**_The Longest Trip Home_**[![](https://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&Password=neuniv&Return=T&type=L&Value=9780061713309&Options=Y)](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13/?searchtype=X&searcharg=longest+trip+home&searchscope=13&sortdropdown=-&SORT=DZ&extended=1&SUBMIT=Search&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=X%28logicomix%29+%26SORT%3DD)

Grogan, author of the best-seller _Marley & Me_, writes a personal memoir about growing up, forging his own identity, and re-connecting and reconciling with his parents. Grogan was raised in a devout Catholic home in suburban Detroit of the 1960s and 1970s. Using a deft blend of humor and compassion, Grogan vividly illustrates his own family in a way that will cause readers to recognize and embrace their own.

**_"Genuinely heart-rending. . .Grogan invests these events with deeply felt humanity and pathos."_**_-Janet Maslin, New York Times ****_
