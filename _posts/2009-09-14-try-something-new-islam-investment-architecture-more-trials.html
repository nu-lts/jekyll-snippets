We're always looking for exciting new content that may be useful to researchers here at NU.  The NU Libraries will often subscribe to a web site for a trial period...if the site is appealing to YOU, and funding is available, we'll purchase access for the university.  A lot of trials are going on right now!

One offer for students of African Americans: the <a href="http://0-bsc.chadwyck.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/">Black Studies Center</a> and <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/proquest_historical/index.php">Historical Black newspapers</a>.   If you're interested in art and architecture, Ebsco's <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/art_complete/?status=edit">Art and Architecture Complete</a> would complement the well-known Avery Index database by offering more full-text access.  And as always, the health sciences are well-represented with the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/ama_manual_online/">AMA Manual</a> to help you publish, the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/henry_stewart_talks/">Henry Stewart Talks</a> which are audiovisual lectures, <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/ageline/index.php">Ageline,</a> with health information about those who are over 50, and <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/cinahl_plus_full/index.php">CINAHL plus with full text</a>, a kind of "CINAHL on steroids" with more full text than our existing CINAHL, plus books, continuing ed modules, quick lessons, and one-million-plus citations.

There's a trial of  <a href="http://0-www.buildinggreen.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/index.cfm">BuildingGreen</a> for students of sustainable building, <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/asia_studies/">Asia Studies Full Text</a> which includes working papers and other grey literature in addition to articles, <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/index_islamicus/index.php">Index Islamicus</a> listing scholarly articles for students of Islam, and the well-known <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/morningstar_investment/index.php">Morningstar Investment Research,</a> which would fill a current library gap in fund analysis information.  If you're a user of BIOSIS, you may prefer <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/biosis_previews/index.php">ISI BIOSIS,</a> where it can be searched alongside Web of Science.

Please feel free to try these out, and help us make recommendations by <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/evaluation/">evaluating them with us</a>!
