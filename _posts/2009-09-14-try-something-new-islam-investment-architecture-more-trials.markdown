We're always looking for exciting new content that may be useful to researchers here at NU.  The NU Libraries will often subscribe to a web site for a trial period...if the site is appealing to YOU, and funding is available, we'll purchase access for the university.  A lot of trials are going on right now!

One offer for students of African Americans: the [Black Studies Center](http://0-bsc.chadwyck.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/) and [Historical Black newspapers](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/proquest_historical/index.php).   If you're interested in art and architecture, Ebsco's [Art and Architecture Complete](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/art_complete/?status=edit) would complement the well-known Avery Index database by offering more full-text access.  And as always, the health sciences are well-represented with the [AMA Manual](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/ama_manual_online/) to help you publish, the [Henry Stewart Talks](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/henry_stewart_talks/) which are audiovisual lectures, [Ageline,](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/ageline/index.php) with health information about those who are over 50, and [CINAHL plus with full text](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/cinahl_plus_full/index.php), a kind of "CINAHL on steroids" with more full text than our existing CINAHL, plus books, continuing ed modules, quick lessons, and one-million-plus citations.

There's a trial of  [BuildingGreen](http://0-www.buildinggreen.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/index.cfm) for students of sustainable building, [Asia Studies Full Text](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/asia_studies/) which includes working papers and other grey literature in addition to articles, [Index Islamicus](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/index_islamicus/index.php) listing scholarly articles for students of Islam, and the well-known [Morningstar Investment Research,](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/morningstar_investment/index.php) which would fill a current library gap in fund analysis information.  If you're a user of BIOSIS, you may prefer [ISI BIOSIS,](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/biosis_previews/index.php) where it can be searched alongside Web of Science.

Please feel free to try these out, and help us make recommendations by [evaluating them with us](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/evaluation/)!
