The _Green Guide Network _([http://www.greenguidenetwork.com/](http://www.greenguidenetwork.com/)) has gone national. This wonderful site provides listings of **ALL THINGS GREEN**. So all you Green-thinking folks come and check it out, many new cities have been added such as New York, Denver, Chicago, Portland, Seattle and even good old Boston. So if you are traveling to Seattle and want to check out what is green there,  such as local farmersâ€™ markets, green events or green tips on the city, this network has it all. They have also launched a job board for those looking for a position with eco-friendly companies around the nation.
