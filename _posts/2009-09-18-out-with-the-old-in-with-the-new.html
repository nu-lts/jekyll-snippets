<p class="MsoNormal">It seems you can’t go anywhere without hearing about the <em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b1886294~S13">Twilight</a></em><span> saga. Or how about <a href="http://www.hbo.com/trueblood">HBO’s </a></span><em><a href="http://www.hbo.com/trueblood">True</a></em><span><a href="http://www.hbo.com/trueblood"> </a></span><em><a href="http://www.hbo.com/trueblood">Blood</a></em><span> series?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>With the recent resurgence of vampires in popular culture, it’s easy to forget that this little slice of horror fiction was once a mainstay in the literary world (I know, <em>Twilight</em><span> fans, Stephanie Meyers’ books are literature… sort of).<span> </span>But I’m thinking more along the lines of Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu’s </span><a title="Internet Archive" href="http://www.archive.org/details/carmilla10007gut" target="_blank"><em>Carmilla</em></a><span><a title="Internet Archive" href="http://www.archive.org/details/carmilla10007gut" target="_blank">,</a> Anne Rice’s </span><em>I<a href="https://nucat.lib.neu.edu:443/record=b1415788~S13">nterview With the Vampire</a></em><span>, even </span><em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b1884843~S13">Salem’s Lot</a></em><span> by Stephen King.<span> </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Yes, it seems that the classics have taken a back seat to their new, hipper counterparts.<span> </span>Recently, I came across Bram Stoker’s <em><a href="https://nucat.lib.neu.edu:443/record=b1429668~S13">Dracula</a></em><span> under the required reading list on a syllabus for one of my fall classes and couldn’t help but smile.<span> </span>But with the exception of a few of us stubborn readers, no one cares about </span><em>those</em><span> books anymore. So in this new age, what’s a classic book lover to do?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Absolutely nothing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It sounds bleak, but the new fans to the genre don’t know anything about the books some of us can’t live without.<span> </span>However, that’s not a bad thing – they’re forging their own icons.<span> </span>And we can all appreciate the revival of the genre.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps it’s best to let the classic novels fade into obscurity.<span> </span>But it doesn’t hurt to pay homage every now and then; so the next time you stop by Snell, make sure to pick up one the classics - even if it’s just to skim the back cover. It’ll be good for you.</p>
