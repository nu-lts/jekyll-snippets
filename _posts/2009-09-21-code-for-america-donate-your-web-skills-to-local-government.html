How can tech improve the accountability and responsiveness of local government?  <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/" target="_blank">Code for America</a> is on it's way to becoming a new non-profit allowing geeks of all stripes to donate their expertise:
<blockquote>Cities are under greater pressure than ever, struggling with budget cuts and outdated technology. What if, instead of cutting services or raising taxes, cities could leverage the power of the web to become more efficient and effective? What if interacting with your local government was more like using Facebook or Yelp? What if, instead of reinventing the wheel every time, cities shared technology resources?</blockquote>
The website's pretty minimal right now, since the project's only in its infancy.  Sign up for email alerts, or check the <a href="http://twitter.com/codeforamerica" target="_blank">Code for America twitter feed</a> for more info.
