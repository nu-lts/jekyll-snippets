Do you want  urban freedom and urban mobility? If so, then check out the <strong><em>YikeBike</em></strong>.

For all you cyclists out there just an FYI to let you know that there is now an electric 2 wheeler bike that is being tested in the UK. It is designed and assembled by a couple of inventive Kiwis. It is hoped that the first orders will be appearing in mid-2010.

This new form of transportation called the <strong><a title="YikeBike" href="http://www.yikebike.com/"><em>Yike Bike</em></a></strong>- it travels up to 13 mph, weights 22 lbs, has a 20 inch front wheel and 8 inch back wheel which are pneumatic, frame is carbon fiber,Â  operated by a lithium phosphate battery that has a charging time of 30 minutes and can range up to 6 miles, has electronic, anti-skid brakes, built-in front, rear, indicator and brake lights. Now, what more could you want?

You can fold it into a bag and carry the 22 pound package to your office and store it under your desk, and no parking problems!
