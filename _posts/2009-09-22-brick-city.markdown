![](https://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&Password=neuniv&Return=T&type=L&Value=9780814757178%20%28cloth%20:%20alk.%20paper%29&Options=Y)I wanted to quickly post on _[Brick City](http://www.sundancechannel.com/brick-city/), _a five-night documentary series that started last night on the Sundance channel.  (I caught the last twenty minutes of it). I had read [glowing](http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/iltw/2009/09/20/brick_city/index.html) reviews of it over the weekend, and so I'm DVR-ing the remaining four nights.  And from what I've seen and read, I would really recommend it. It focuses on Newark, New Jersey, and its mayor, Cory Booker, as well as a number of citizens: Jayda and Creep, a couple who are also a Blood and a Crip respectively; Ras Baraka, principal of Newark's Central High School; and Police Director Gary McCarthy.

I also tried to [search](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13/?searchtype=d&searcharg=newark&searchscope=13&SORT=DZ&extended=1&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=dnewark%2C+nj ) for some background materials in our Library that relate to the history of Newark.  You can find (among others) [mystery novels](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/dnewark/dnewark/1%2C109%2C145%2CE/2exact&FF=dnewark+african+american+women+new+jersey+fiction&1%2C3%2C), [government documents](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/dnewark/dnewark/1%2C109%2C145%2CE/2exact&FF=dnewark+bay+water+pollution+new+jersey&1%2C2%2C), [history books](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/dnewark/dnewark/51%2C109%2C145%2CE/frameset&FF=dnewark+n+j+politics+and+government+++20th+century&1%2C1%2C), and [a 2008 New Yorker piece by Peter Boyer on Cory Booker](http://0-find.galegroup.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/gtx/retrieve.do?contentSet=IAC-Documents&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&qrySerId=Locale%28en%2CUS%2C%29%3AFQE%3D%28sn%2CNone%2C9%290028-792X%3AAnd%3AFQE%3D%28TX%2CNone%2C14%29peter+j.+boyer%24&sgHitCountType=None&inPS=true&sort=DateDescend&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&tabID=T003&prodId=PROF&searchId=R2&currentPosition=8&userGroupName=mlin_b_northest&docId=A174218239&docType=IAC) (His piece is from February 4, 2008 and is titled "The Color of Politics").
