As some of the readers may or may not know I am also an intern and writer at [Blast Magazine](http://blastmagazine.com/). I penned (keyboarded?) an [article](http://blastmagazine.com/the-magazine/technology/2009/09/boston-is-one-of-the-greenest-water-protecting-cities/) for them last week that stated that Boston had been listed as one of America’s leading cities for protecting clean water and the public with green solutions by an organization called [American Rivers](http://www.americanrivers.org/). This is due to the purchase of various wetlands adjacent to the Charles, which helps prevent floods and water damage.




Currently, sections of a climate bill are being debated in Congress which would establish standards for dealing with natural disasters such as drought and waterborne disease. American Rivers’ report could lead to Boston becoming a national model in this area.




Northeastern University's Libraries possess an [expansive collection ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13/X?SEARCH=(Environment)+and+(Sustainability)&searchscope=13&SORT=D)on works relating to environmetal sustainability. I reccommend anyone interested in this area check them out.
