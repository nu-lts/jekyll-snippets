This is a an addendum to the blog that I did on the <em><strong>Green Car Challenge</strong></em>.

California has plans for the world's first solar-powered, fast-charging, electric car charging corridor. Well done California, they seem to be moving ahead with renewable transportation, solar power and zero emissions.

It seems that <a title="SolarCity" href="http://www.solarcity.com/"><strong>Solar City</strong></a> and <a title="Rabobank" href="https://www.rabobankamerica.com/index.jsp"><strong>Rabobank</strong></a> are going to be teaming up to create a carbon-free trip for those who own electric vehicles along Highway 101 from San Francisco to Los Angeles, (this is approximately 400 miles.)

This means one can now commute long-distances, and use these EV (electric vehicle) charging stations like gas stations. SolarCity will build four Tesla fast-charging stations at Salinas, Atascadero, Santa Maria and Goleta. These four charging stations <span style="Arial;"><span style="small;">will provide a full charge in one-third the amount of time of other stations.</span></span>

The hope is that after focusing on cars produced at <a title="Telsa Motors" href="http://www.teslamotors.com/"><strong>Telsa Motors</strong></a>, they plan to retrofit these to fit all electric vehicles, eventually making all the stations solar-powered.

So with an eye to zero emissions, faster charging times, renewable transportation and wonderful scenery what more could one want?
