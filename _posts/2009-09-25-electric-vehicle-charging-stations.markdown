![Electric Vehicle Charging Station](http://keetsa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/electric-vehicle-charging-station-241x300.jpg)

This is a an addendum to the blog that I did on the _**Green Car Challenge**_.

California has plans for the world's first solar-powered, fast-charging, electric car charging corridor. Well done California, they seem to be moving ahead with renewable transportation, solar power and zero emissions.

It seems that [**Solar City**](http://www.solarcity.com/) and [**Rabobank**](https://www.rabobankamerica.com/index.jsp) are going to be teaming up to create a carbon-free trip for those who own electric vehicles along Highway 101 from San Francisco to Los Angeles, (this is approximately 400 miles.)

This means one can now commute long-distances, and use these EV (electric vehicle) charging stations like gas stations. SolarCity will build four Tesla fast-charging stations at Salinas, Atascadero, Santa Maria and Goleta. These four charging stations will provide a full charge in one-third the amount of time of other stations.

The hope is that after focusing on cars produced at [**Telsa Motors**](http://www.teslamotors.com/), they plan to retrofit these to fit all electric vehicles, eventually making all the stations solar-powered.

So with an eye to zero emissions, faster charging times, renewable transportation and wonderful scenery what more could one want?
