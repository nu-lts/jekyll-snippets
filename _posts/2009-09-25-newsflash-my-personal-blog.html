Hi all inquiring minds,

I just want to take this short opportunity to let readers of this blog know that I have my own personal blog, unrelated to the library or Northeastern, at http://<a href="http://www.thecollectordamong.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">thecollectordamong.blogspot.com</a>. This blog is all about Movies, generally speaking. I write a lot of film criticism, though also stuff that can't really be called film criticism, just writing about films. Those who are not very interested in Movies will probably not find anything of consistent interest, though I'd encourage Cinema Studies, Comm Studies and Journalism Majors in particular to check it out.

On this blog, I have covered certain films available in Snell, such as many films in the <a href="http://www.criterion.com/" target="_blank">Criterion Collection</a>,<a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xstan+brakhage&amp;SORT=D/Xstan+brakhage&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=stan%20brakhage/1%2C13%2C13%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xstan+brakhage&amp;SORT=D&amp;8%2C8%2C"> Stan Brakahge's Films</a>,  <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xwr+mysteries+of+the+organism&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=DZ/Xwr+mysteries+of+the+organism&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=1&amp;SUBKEY=wr%20mysteries%20of%20the%20organism/1%2C2%2C2%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xwr+mysteries+of+the+organism&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;1%2C1%2C">W.R:Mysteries of the Organism</a>,  as well as the magazine<a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/"> Sight &amp; Sound</a>, which can be found in Snell's magazine section on the second floor. I also update the blog according to the errors that I find, and I try to write something new at least three times a month.

Thanks, and I hope you enjoy.
