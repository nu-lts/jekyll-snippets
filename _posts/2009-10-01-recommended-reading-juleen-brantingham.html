<p class="MsoNormal">I’m often classified as a literary nerd.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I’m proud to say that’s completely true.<span> </span>I absolutely love reading, but even those of us who enjoy burying our noses in a good book can occasionally suffer from short attention spans.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That’s where the beauty of short stories can truly be appreciated.<span> </span>Recently, I was introduced to the writings of Juleen Brantingham.<span> </span>I have quite a few short story compilations and though I have come across her name a handful of times, I’d never actually read one of her stories.<span> </span>In this instance, a story she had written entitled “Something About Camilla” came to my attention and I decided to give it try.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By the time I’d finished it, it had become an instant favorite.<span> </span>The story itself, which deals with a group of friends at their high school reunion, was quite good.<span> </span>However, it was the build up and development of the story that really impressed me.<span> </span>I wouldn’t quite call it a horror story, more like mystery with a few creepy moments sprinkled in.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Although the story is not easy to come across, it is available in Snell as it is a featured short story in <em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b1300807~S13">Final Shadows</a></em> – the last installment of the <em>Shadows</em> anthology.<span> </span></p>
