I’m often classified as a literary nerd.







I’m proud to say that’s completely true. I absolutely love reading, but even those of us who enjoy burying our noses in a good book can occasionally suffer from short attention spans.







That’s where the beauty of short stories can truly be appreciated. Recently, I was introduced to the writings of Juleen Brantingham. I have quite a few short story compilations and though I have come across her name a handful of times, I’d never actually read one of her stories. In this instance, a story she had written entitled “Something About Camilla” came to my attention and I decided to give it try.







By the time I’d finished it, it had become an instant favorite. The story itself, which deals with a group of friends at their high school reunion, was quite good. However, it was the build up and development of the story that really impressed me. I wouldn’t quite call it a horror story, more like mystery with a few creepy moments sprinkled in.










Although the story is not easy to come across, it is available in Snell as it is a featured short story in _[Final Shadows](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b1300807~S13)_ – the last installment of the _Shadows_ anthology.
