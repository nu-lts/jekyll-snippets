This coming Wednesday, the Library is co-sponsoring a talk titled "The Race Beat: Then and Now" along with the Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project (CRRJ), the Northeastern University Law School Forum, and the School of Journalism.

With Gene Roberts, Hank Klibanoff authored [_The Race Beat_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xrace+beat&SORT=D/Xrace+beat&SORT=D&SUBKEY=race%20beat/1%2C22%2C22%2CE/frameset&FF=Xrace+beat&SORT=D&1%2C1%2C), winning a Pulitzer for the work in 2007.  Klibanoff, former managing editor of the _Atlanta Constitution _and a distinguished journalist (with a successful stint at the _Boston Globe_), is currently managing editor of the Cold Case Truth and Justice Project.  As he describes it, "this multimedia, multi-partner project uses investigative reporting to dig out the truth behind unsolved racial murders that took place during the modern civil rights era in the South.  The project, led by the Center for Investigative Reporting, is using professional reporters, documentary filmmakers, multimedia experts, public interest advocacy groups and lawyers to fill in history's huge gaps, to correct its myths and to bring exposure, reconciliation and, where possible, criminal prosecution."  Klibanoff, a long-time resident of Atlanta, is working on a Corporation for Public Broadcasting-funded treatment for a four-part documentary series on unsolved civil rights murders.

Joining Hank Klibanoff will be Judy Richardson, award-winning filmmaker (_Eyes on the Prize, _American Experience's _Malcolm X Make it Plain_), educator, and lifelong social and civil rights activist.  Richardson was a staff member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) for three years in the early 1960s.  Richardson will show a clip from her newest documentary, _Scarred Justice: The Orangeburg Massacre 1968. _Described as a "powerful antidote to historical amnesia," the film has won wide acclaim.

Margaret Burnham, Director of CRRJ, will moderate.
