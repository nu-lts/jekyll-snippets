The University Archives and Special Collections here at the NU Libraries are a treasure trove of information about the history of the Co-op program, now in its 100th year at Northeastern University.

In celebration of  the Co-op Centennial, we've assembled a <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/coop100/" target="_blank">Guide to Co-op Centennial Resources</a>, describing the Archives'  photos, videos, manuscripts and books relating to NU's Co-op program through the years.  We hope you enjoy it!
