Do you want to keep up on the latest new and upcoming books on a specific aspect of Environmentalism?

Then every Wednesday check out <em><strong><a title="The Green Life" href="http://sierraclub.typepad.com/greenlife/2009/09/book-rounduup-wednesday-food-politics.html">The Green Life</a></strong></em>, or subscribe to their <em>RSS</em> feed and receive it on your computer.

If your interest is  Food Politics, then maybe <em><a title="Uncovering the Global Food Scandal" href="http://www.amazon.com/Waste-Uncovering-Global-Food-Scandal/dp/0393068366">Waste: Uncovering the Global Food Scanda</a>l</em> is a book for you. This is written by Tristram Stuart who has become so dedicated to reducing food waste that he has become a <em><strong>FREEGAN </strong></em>(some one who lives off discarded or self-produced food).  Through his investigations he finds out that it is not underproduction but waste  that is at the cause of world's food problems.

Or maybe it is Building Green Communities<em>,</em> then how about looking at <a title="Change the World for ten bucks" href="http://www.amazon.com/Change-World-Ten-Bucks-actions/dp/081186801X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1253569248&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Change the World for ten Bucks: small actions x lots of people = Big Change</em></a>. This is by a London-based nonprofit <em><a title="We Are What We Do" href="http://www.wearewhatwedo.org/">We Are What We</a> Do</em> which has put together 50 actions that can lead to more sustainable communities.

Each week they cover a different subject, such as: Forests, Building Green Communities and making craft projects from recycled or eco-friendly materials.

You never know what you will find.

It could be something new that you might just become passionate about.
