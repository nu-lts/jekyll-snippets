Do you want to keep up on the latest new and upcoming books on a specific aspect of Environmentalism?

Then every Wednesday check out _**[The Green Life](http://sierraclub.typepad.com/greenlife/2009/09/book-rounduup-wednesday-food-politics.html)**_, or subscribe to their _RSS_ feed and receive it on your computer.

If your interest is  Food Politics, then maybe _[Waste: Uncovering the Global Food Scanda](http://www.amazon.com/Waste-Uncovering-Global-Food-Scandal/dp/0393068366)l_ is a book for you. This is written by Tristram Stuart who has become so dedicated to reducing food waste that he has become a _**FREEGAN **_(some one who lives off discarded or self-produced food).  Through his investigations he finds out that it is not underproduction but waste  that is at the cause of world's food problems.

Or maybe it is Building Green Communities_,_ then how about looking at [_Change the World for ten Bucks: small actions x lots of people = Big Change_](http://www.amazon.com/Change-World-Ten-Bucks-actions/dp/081186801X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253569248&sr=1-1). This is by a London-based nonprofit _[We Are What We](http://www.wearewhatwedo.org/) Do_ which has put together 50 actions that can lead to more sustainable communities.

Each week they cover a different subject, such as: Forests, Building Green Communities and making craft projects from recycled or eco-friendly materials.

You never know what you will find.

It could be something new that you might just become passionate about.

If you see a book that you think the Library should invest in, you can recommend it[ here](http://www.lib.neu.edu/libraries_and_collections/collections/recommend_a_purchase/).
