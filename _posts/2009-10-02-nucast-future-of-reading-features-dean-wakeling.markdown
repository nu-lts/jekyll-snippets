I just finished watching the latest NuCast installment--a live discussion on the Future of Reading, with our library dean, Will Wakeling,  and Professor of English and Vice-Provost Mary Loeffelholz, along with Eve Bridburg, a literary agent, (moderated by Tawna Rathe).

It started out with a discussion of the [Kindle](http://amzn.com/B00154JDAI), and then took up the question of whether it's different to read books, write about and discuss books, edit, sell, and preserve books, when books are digital. (Not to give anything away, but the short answer is "Yes!")  It's less than an hour long, and if you missed it, for now anyway [you can watch it here](http://www.northeastern.edu/news/multimedia/video.html?contentID=wxE2HZQgf0ir_LWg8nZ20A).
