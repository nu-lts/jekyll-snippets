Buongiorno! Guten Tag! Ni hao! As the librarian at Snell for foreign languages and literatures, I've received quite a few requests for the library to provide online language-learning products to the NU community. So I'm very pleased to report that we are currently offering a free trial of [Mango Languages](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/mango_languages11/), a completely web-based language-learning system that focuses on actual conversation skills. The trial will last until the end of October.

The languages currently available from Mango are Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and English as a Second Language for speakers of Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, or Polish. They plan to add more languages in the future.

Mango is a very popular product with many public libraries and is supposed to be very easy to use. We are running the free trial now with the hope that we will be able to buy either this product or one like it. So, we need your feedback! [Try Mango Languages](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/mango_languages11/) and [let us know](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/evaluation/) what you think!
