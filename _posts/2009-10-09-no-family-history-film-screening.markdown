Next Tuesday, October 13th, the NU Department of Sociology and Anthropology, the [Northeastern Environmental Justice Research Collaborative](http://www.socant.neu.edu/research/justice_research/), and the Northeastern Facilities Department of Sustainability and Energy will be joining forces to present a free screening of the film [_No Family History_](http://www.nofamilyhistory.org/). This film, made by environmental sociologist [Sabrina McCormick](http://sociology.msu.edu/smccormick.html), addresses the environmental causes of breast cancer, such as toxins in personal care products. It also looks at the movement to improve regulations to prevent breast cancer as opposed to focusing on finding a cure.

Sabrina McCormick, who has done extensive research on the connection between environmental toxins and health will be giving a talk after the screening. This event ties in well with both [NU's Sustainability Week](http://www.northeastern.edu/sustainability/events/index.html) and [Breast Cancer Awareness Month](http://www.nbcam.org/) and is sure to be an eye opener. The screening will be held October 13th from 6:00 - 8:30 PM in 105 Shillmam.
