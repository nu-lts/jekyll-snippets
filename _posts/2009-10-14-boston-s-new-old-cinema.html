(This is a revised version of a post that appeared on my own <a href="http://thecollectordamong.blogspot.com" target="_blank">blog</a>.)

As every movie-fan in Boston knows, this city does not have a single movie theater that represents independent and foreign films (I refuse to use that word that begins with 'art' and ends with 'house.') This is a source of frustration, to myself and others, as we have to hike over to Cambridge on a regular basis if we want to see one of the <a href="http://www.brattlefilm.org/brattlefilm/index.html" target="_blank">Brattle's Elements of Cinema </a>series films, or an obscure screening at the <a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/" target="_blank">Harvard Film Archive</a>, or even the somewhat-more-mainstream fare of the <a href="http://www.landmarktheaters.com/Market/Boston/Boston_Frameset.htm" target="_blank">Kendall Square Cinema</a>.
Â But some very exciting news just came to my attention today: the <a href="http://www.stuartstreetplayhouse.com/" target="_blank">Stuart Street Playhouse</a>, formerly called Cinema 57 over thirty years ago, is reopening as a one-screen cinema for Independent and Foreign films. The theater originally shut it's doors in 1996 and since then has been a theater and, interestingly, a place where golf classes are held. It will stay with the name Stuart Street Playhouse, but soon we can expect to simply walk up to the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=theater+district+boston&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=theater+district&amp;hnear=boston&amp;cid=0,0,2246874321263197504&amp;ei=PP7VSqHcHIfSlAenqqmdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQnwIwAA" target="_blank">Theater District </a>and shuttle in to a theater that isn't <a href="http://www.amctheatres.com/theatres/index.html" target="_blank">Loews</a>.
This is hopeful news for the world of film in ways that do not need to be elaborated on, and remarkable in this age of unceasing downloads and <a href="http://www.netflix.com/Default?mqso=80025185" target="_blank">Netflix </a>arrivals. I wonder, are any other cities in this country experiencing similar revivals? Any other cities in the world, for that matter?
