Highlights include a screening of the film <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/record=b2224368~S13" target="_blank"><em>Blue Gold: World Water Wars</em></a>, a performance by the musical group <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5acljQdL0Y&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">Recycled Percussion</a> (who recently took third place on <em>America's Got Talent</em>), a green business networking event, and a panel presentation about how you can reduce toxic exposures in your daily life.

It looks like this is going to be a very interesting, exciting week!
