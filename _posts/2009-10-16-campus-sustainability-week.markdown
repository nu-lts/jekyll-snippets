Next week, October 19th through 23rd will be NU's first ever Sustainability Week. There will be all sorts of informative and entertaining programs throughout the week. You can see the full event list [here](http://www.northeastern.edu/sustainability/events/index.html).

Highlights include a screening of the film [_Blue Gold: World Water Wars_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/record=b2224368~S13), a performance by the musical group [Recycled Percussion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5acljQdL0Y&feature=related) (who recently took third place on _America's Got Talent_), a green business networking event, and a panel presentation about how you can reduce toxic exposures in your daily life.

It looks like this is going to be a very interesting, exciting week!
