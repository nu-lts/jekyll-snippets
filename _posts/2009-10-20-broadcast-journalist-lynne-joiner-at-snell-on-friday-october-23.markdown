Join us on Friday, October 23 at 12 pm, as Emmy-award winning journalist Lynne Joiner discusess her book, [_Honorable Survivor: Mao’s China, McCarthy’s America and the Persecution of John S. Service._](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/aJoiner,+Lynne./ajoiner+lynne/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FF=ajoiner+lynne&1%2C1%2C)_  _John Service was an American foreign service officer, who was often blamed for "losing" China, and who came to be a target for US officials like Joe McCarthy and J. Edgar Hoover.  In addition to recently unsealed government documents, Joiner had access to personal papers and photographs of Service and his associates that she weaves into her historical account and presentation.
