After you decide to do your family history the first step is to decide which side of your family you want to start with and what you want to find out . When you fill out a chart you usually start with your self and go backwards with the information you have. You can either create your own chart or use a family tree program or a web site.

2  Web Sites that offer free charts:

[http://www.ancestry.com/trees/charts/researchcal.aspx](http://www.ancestry.com/trees/charts/researchcal.aspx)

[http://www.familysearch.org](http://www.familysearch.org)

(At Family Search, look on the left hand side and you will see "Pedigree Charts," click on the link.)

Once you put down the information you already know it's time to start with relatives and continue to fill in the chart with information they have.
