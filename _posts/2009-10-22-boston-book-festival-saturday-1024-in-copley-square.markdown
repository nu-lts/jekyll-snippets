I'll be volunteering at the first annual Boston Book Festival being held this Saturday (10/24) in Copley Square.Â  The festival features 90 authors reading from their works and signing books, and 40 exhibitors. Events will be taking place at the Boston Public Library, Trinity Church, and the Old South Church. And, it's free!

The keynote speaker will be Pulitzer Prize-winning author Orhan Pamuk. However, I admit I'm most intrigued by the session called "Writer Idol," in which an actor will read the first pages of unpublished manuscripts submitted by audience members, and a panel of judges (editors and literary agents) will offer their opinions on what works and what doesn't.
