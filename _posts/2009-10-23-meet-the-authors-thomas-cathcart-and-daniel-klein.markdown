Â Tomorrow at 10:30 am in 90 Snell Library, authors Thomas Cathcart and Daniel Klein return by popular demand. Their new book, _[Heidegger and a Hippo walk through those Pearly Gates](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~/a?searchtype=X&searcharg=heidegger+hippo&SORT=D)_, is another in their line of philosopical treatises presented through jokes, in the same vein as their previous books, _Plato and a Platypus walk in to a bar..._ and _Aristotle and an Aardvark go to Washington. _

The NU Bookstore will be selling copies that the authors will be signing. The book is also available at Snell Libraries.

You can also watch their previous talk at Snell Library:
