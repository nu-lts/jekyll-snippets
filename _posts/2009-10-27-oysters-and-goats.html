Sure, we've heard all about the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/mowing-with-goats.html" target="_blank">Google Goats</a>. And you may have heard about the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/10/17/andover_to_mow_meadow_with_a_herd_of_hungry_browsers/" target="_blank">Andover Goats</a>. Great idea, yes? Use goats to mow down the growth?

I recently found out about a <a href="http://massoyster.org/" target="_blank">similar program</a> for the <a href="http://www.northendwaterfront.com/home/2009/10/25/oysters-reintroduced-to-boston-harbor.html" target="_blank">Boston Harbor</a>. Oysters are being reintroduced to help clear out the water - an oyster can filter 30 gallons of water per day. Amazing! The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zm-yMpHsaQ" target="_blank">time lapse video</a> of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay was incredible to watch. Who knew that oysters and goats had so much in common?

Now that I know about this project, I am inspired to see if there are any magazine or journal articles that talk more about oysters and ecosystems, or water purification. I bet <a href="http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?uthtype=ip,uid&amp;profile=ehost&amp;defaultdb=8gh" target="_blank">GreenFILE</a> would be a good database to start with!
