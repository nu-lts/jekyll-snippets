Sure, we've heard all about the [Google Goats](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/mowing-with-goats.html). And you may have heard about the [Andover Goats](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/10/17/andover_to_mow_meadow_with_a_herd_of_hungry_browsers/). Great idea, yes? Use goats to mow down the growth?

I recently found out about a [similar program](http://massoyster.org/) for the [Boston Harbor](http://www.northendwaterfront.com/home/2009/10/25/oysters-reintroduced-to-boston-harbor.html). Oysters are being reintroduced to help clear out the water - an oyster can filter 30 gallons of water per day. Amazing! The [time lapse video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zm-yMpHsaQ) of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay was incredible to watch. Who knew that oysters and goats had so much in common?

Now that I know about this project, I am inspired to see if there are any magazine or journal articles that talk more about oysters and ecosystems, or water purification. I bet [GreenFILE](http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?uthtype=ip,uid&profile=ehost&defaultdb=8gh) would be a good database to start with!
