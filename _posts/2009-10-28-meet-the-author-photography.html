Hello Snippets visitors!

This year, the Library Advancement Office has hired me to photograph its Meet the Author series, allowing those who miss the opportunity to see an event to get an idea of what happened during an author's presentation. Though these photographs have yet to make it to print, technology has granted the Northeastern community the ability to view them, and others from past years, instantly online. If you haven't yet attended a Meet the Author event (and a strongly suggest you do!), I urge you to check out the Snippets Gallery and the library's Flickr account, which can be found at:

If you like what you see or if there's anything you would like to see more of, please feel free to post a comment. I'd love to hear from you!
