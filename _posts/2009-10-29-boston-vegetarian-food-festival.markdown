Those of you looking for something fun and not Halloween-related to do this weekend should check out the [Boston Vegetarian Food Festival](http://bostonveg.org/foodfest/). It's happening Oct 31st from 10 AM to 6 PM and Nov 1st from 10 AM to 4 PM at the [Reggie Lewis Athletic Center](http://www.rltac.com/Directions/directions.html), 1350 Tremont Street, Boston. There will be [cooking demonstrations and talks](http://bostonveg.org/foodfest/speakers.html) on everything from the basics of vegetarianism, to nutrition, to the effects of diet on global warming. There will also be plenty of exhibitors giving out free samples, educational exhibits on animals and the environment and children's activities. Best of all, everything is free. Stop by and learn how you can eat healthier and help the environment.
