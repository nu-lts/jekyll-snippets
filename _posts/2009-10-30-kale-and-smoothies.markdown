This summer, I went to Kauai for the first time. It was beautiful, lush, and welcoming; the most casual, chill place I've ever been to (basically one road circles the island) with the most amazing little locally-owned food places. They were staffed with awesome, personable, enthusiastic, hippie types, and stocked with fresh, delicious, local, healthful dishes, drinks, and desserts!

I, of course, made the point of getting a smoothie as often as possible - green smoothies! Two of mine were made with a ton of kale, banana, ginger and spirulina. Yum!

Now, I'm noticing kale everywhere and I plan to buy a big bunch and make up a crazy green ginger smoothie for myself. What else will I use with kale? Quiche? Pasta?

Also, I've dubbed this semester Smoothie Semester, where I plan to experiment with fruits and veggies you don't get in your regular smoothie... and see what happens.
