The Snell Archives collection-- I am talking about the magazine archives, located on the 3rd floor-- is an impressive archive collection; certainly more impressive than I ever expected. But I only discovered it late last semester, during the lazy spring days when I had nothing much to do and was in a limbo between the summer (spent in New York) and Boston (the rest of the year.) Old editions of the [_New Yorker_ ](http://www.newyorker.com/)filled that limbo.

But it wasn't only the New Yorker. I only mention the New Yorker because I'm obviously a [Latte-sipping leftist-elitist](http://alterdestiny.blogspot.com/2008/12/latte-sipping-elitists.html). They have everything from Psychology Journals to _[The Partisan Review](http://www.bu.edu/partisanreview/index.html). _Each archival volume comes in a large, hardcover binding with no words on it save the spine. Each volume is a little bit dusty, making it look more nostalgic and making you feel as if your participating in some secret ritual. (Whenever I'm in this area, I never see anybody else looking through the archives. Only today, when some lost-seeming soul walked past and peered down the aisle at me in incomprehension, was it confirmed that this is indeed a _secret_ ritual.) Each volume is color coded: the _New Yorker_ is blue, for example. _[Harpers](http://www.harpers.org/)_ is black.

My only qualm with the archives section is that it is cut in two by several rows of books. I understand that there may be problems of organization, but can't these books be moved elsewhere? But I really only have this problem because I'm an obsessive of a certain kind. I'm an information junkie. I like things of the past that are long and gone. I have become, quite unintentionally, a lover of magazines. Above all, I like flipping through the 1978  editions of the _New Yorker _and seeing what [Pauline Kael ](http://womenshistory.about.com/library/bio/blbio_pauline_kael.htm)had to say about movies in those glorious days.
