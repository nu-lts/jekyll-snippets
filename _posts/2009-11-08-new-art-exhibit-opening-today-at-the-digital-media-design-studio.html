We will be showcasing the excellent work of several student photographers from the Huntington News over the past year, all of which demonstrate the power of the image to tell a story and highlight seminal issues in our community. In the DMDS, we encourage students to use digital media resources to present educational content in expressive forums, and these photos are a powerful representation of that paradigm. Please join us to view the photos and see what the DMDS has to offer for your own creative projects. Light refreshments will be served. </span></span> <!--EndFragment-->
