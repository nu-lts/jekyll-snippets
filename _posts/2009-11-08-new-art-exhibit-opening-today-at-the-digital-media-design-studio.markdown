**_“Cornerstones”
_The Huntington News Photography Exhibit ** 

**Opening: Friday, Nov. 6, 2- 4 p.m.
Digital Media Design Studio, ****Snell Library**
** 2nd Floor, Room 200
**
We will be showcasing the excellent work of several student photographers from the Huntington News over the past year, all of which demonstrate the power of the image to tell a story and highlight seminal issues in our community. In the DMDS, we encourage students to use digital media resources to present educational content in expressive forums, and these photos are a powerful representation of that paradigm. Please join us to view the photos and see what the DMDS has to offer for your own creative projects. Light refreshments will be served.
