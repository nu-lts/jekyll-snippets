Reserve requests for theÂ Spring semester are due by December 4th. Please submit all reserve requests by this date to ensure that items are on reserve for your students by the start of the term. You can submit a request by filling out the electronic form under the Library tab at <a href="http://myneu.neu.edu/cp/home/loginf" target="_blank">myneu.neu.edu</a> or by turning in a manual request form, which is available at the Circulation Desk in Snell Library. If you would like to request an item for reserves that is not currently in the library's collection, please see <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/course_reserves/documents/TextbooksCourseReserves.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/course_reserves/documents/TextbooksCourseReserves.pdf</a>.
