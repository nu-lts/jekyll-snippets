On Nov. 14, Joan Krizack, University Archivist and head of Special Collections here at the Libraries participated in a talk about the tumultuous history of rent control in Cambridge.
The event took place from 1-3PM at the Free Masonâ€™s Lodge at 1950 Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge.
Rent control has existed in some for another in Cambridge from 1971 until it was repealed in 1994. The event which included Krizack as well as Denise Jillson, formerly of the Small Property Owners Association and Bill Cavellini of Eviction Free Zone, focused on the examination of primary documents from organizations dealing with rent control.
The event also focused on how these documents, now in archives and often supplemented by firsthand accounts and oral history, provide primary source material to researchers and histioorians as well as future generations.
