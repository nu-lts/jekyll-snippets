<strong>Win $100 for the NU Bookstore in a naming contest for a new comfy reading area in Snell Library.</strong>

Thanks for your interest, but as of midnight December 9th we are no longer accepting submissions. We'll choose a new name and notify the winner by December 21st, and please come visit the new collection when it's done!

We're excited to announce a new better-than-ever leisure reading collection right in the heart of Snell Library. Coming in Spring 2010, you will star gaze upon bestsellers, literary fiction, graphic novels, DVDs, and prize-winning non-fiction all in the same place. We hope this new area becomes your first stop when you need an ohhhm break, are searching for that special book to challenge you, expand your horizons, or simply to make you laugh out loud.

The winning name will be used on the Library's website as well as on signs. The winner receives: <strong>A) immense personal satisfaction</strong> and <strong>B) $100 gift card to the NU Bookstore</strong>.
