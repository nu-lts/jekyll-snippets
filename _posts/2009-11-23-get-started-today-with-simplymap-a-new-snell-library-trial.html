<a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/simplymap/"><strong>SimplyMap</strong></a> is a very exciting new web-based mapping application that lets you quickly create professional-quality thematic maps and reports, using thousands of US demographic, business and marketing data variables. Want to know the top 10 wealthiest ZIP codes in Massachusetts or Maine? How about the top 25 counties in California with the most elderly residents? With SimplyMap, the answers are at your fingertips.

SimplyMap includes all kinds of variables such as consumer expenditures, quality of life, retail sales, CPI, employment, education, income, housing, population, race, language, ethnicity, ancestry and transportation.  All can be built into your map!
