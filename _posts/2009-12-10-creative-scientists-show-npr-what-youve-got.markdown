National Public Radio is inviting listeners to use your creativity to express your feelings about science!  You describe a scientific phenomenon in video, and if your video is selected, NPR will feature it on their YouTube site.

The project is called [WonderScope](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120318815&ft=1&f=120318815), and is designed to get radio listeners involved in a communicating about science using web-based multimedia.  Here's how it works:

1. NPR gives you a topic and a length. For example, the first topic is _time_, the length is _30 seconds to 3 minutes_.
2. Sign in to YouTube and upload your video

...and get ready for the Academy Awards!
