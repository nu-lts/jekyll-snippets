IEEE has just launched their new IEEE _Xplore_ MobileBeta. With this service, anyone can search articles in the IEEE _Xplore_ digital library from any Web-enabled phone. IEEE is looking for opinions on the site and ideas on how to improve it.

Go to [http://m.ieeexplore.ieee.org](http://cl.exct.net/?ju=fe551c75736c027f7214&ls=fde91775756105747c1d7971&m=fefa1174706601&l=fecb15737163017d&s=fe3110727565027a741c71&jb=ffcf14&t=) to start searching on any internet-enabled mobile device, try the new site, and send feedback via the link at the bottom of the mobile Web page. You can email the article link to yourself for future viewing of the full-text, or read the abstracts right on your phone.

Using  the IEEE _Xplore_® Mobile Beta, you can do a basic search, display the top 10 results by relevancy, and view abstracts and citations. To view the full-text of an article, the user can email the link to any email address and then view the article directly from the main IEEE _Xplore_ Web site when they are on their personal computer.  All Northeastern students, faculty and staff have access to the IEEE Xplore Library.

IEEE Xplore Mobile is viewable on all Web-enabled mobile devices. It has been optimized for newer mobile devices (i.e., Apple iPhone, Blackberry Storm). When using older mobile devices (i.e., Blackberry 8360, Blackberry Curve), you may be able to choose "Internet Browser" as your default browser in your device's options for optimal viewing.

Try it out and let IEEE know what you think.
