Congratulations to<strong> Hillary Corbett</strong> on her movement to the new position of Scholarly Communication Librarian this past October!  She has chaired the Library's Scholarly Communication Committee, which worked on outreach to faculty about issues affecting them as researchers and authors, since its inception.

Corbett's new full-time position is devoted to <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/scholarly/" target="_blank">scholarly communication</a> to advance the Library's focus on supporting research and publishing on campus; to promote the value of <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/iris/" target="_blank">IRis </a>as a research repository and publishing tool; and to keep the university community informed about relevant issues such as <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/scholarly/for_faculty/open_access/" target="_blank">open access</a>.

In addition to her responsibilities as committee chair, she was formerly the Assistant Head for Receipt and Resource Control. There she supervised the group responsible for receiving and cataloging print materials for the Library, managing print journal subscriptions, and the physical processing (labeling, binding, etc.) of all library materials.

Hillary says she plans to use <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets" target="_self">Snell Snippets</a>, in addition to <a href="http://delicious.com/sc.at.neu" target="_blank">the feed </a>already in place, to share information on scholarly communication.  Stay tuned!
