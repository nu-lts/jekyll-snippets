I'm going to cut down on the length for this one, as I realize I have this tendency to write <em>Finnegan's Wake</em> in blog format. This is simply a list of good Christmas books and Movies that I think every one should check out. I have purposefully made it more obscure than most Christmas lists, which have all the usual books and movies listed on them that you've already seen a million times.

In terms of books and stories:

<em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/cPR4557.A2+D68+2006/cpr+4557+a2+d68+2006/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=cpr+4557+a2+d68+2006&amp;1%2C1%2C" target="_blank">A Christmas Carol</a></em>, Charles Dickens: Enough has already been said about this one. I included it because, although not very unknown, I feel not many people read the original.

<em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/X(thomas%2C%20dylan)&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=D/X(thomas%2C%20dylan)&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=(thomas%2C%20dylan)/1%2C95%2C95%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=X(thomas%2C%20dylan)&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=D&amp;1%2C1%2C" target="_blank">A Child's Christmas in Wales</a></em>, Dylan Thomas: Great short story from a guy who was known primarily as a poet; autobiographical sketch is a more accurate word.

<em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xbest+american+short+stories+of+the+century&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=DZ/Xbest+american+short+stories+of+the+century&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=1&amp;SUBKEY=best%20american%20short%20stories%20of%20the%20century/1%2C15%2C15%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xbest+american+short+stories+of+the+century&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;1%2C1%2C#" target="_blank">The Ledge</a></em>, Lawrence Sargent Hall: This is a very unheardof story that can be found in the massive collection <em>The Best American Short Stories of The Century</em>, edited by John Updike. This is a tragic piece of work, so don't expect holiday cheer, exactly.

<em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xthe+nutcracker&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=D/Xthe+nutcracker&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=the%20nutcracker/1%2C22%2C22%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xthe+nutcracker&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=D&amp;7%2C7%2C" target="_blank">The Nutcracker</a></em>, E.T.A. Hoffman: The original story is fairly interesting. You can see the temptation to make it in to some kind of spectacle like a ballet, for example.

Lastly, for the books, is one that I wrote a post about earlier this semester:

<em><a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=380" target="_blank">Sir Gawain and The Green Knight</a>: </em>Only debatably a Christmas story, I suppose. But I consider it one. It's story is framed by the holiday season, and it's intense Christianity (okay, Paganism) is the focal reason I would call it 'christmas-y'

In terms of Movies:

<em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xfanny+and+alexander&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=DZ/Xfanny+and+alexander&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=1&amp;SUBKEY=fanny%20and%20alexander/1%2C5%2C5%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xfanny+and+alexander&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;1%2C1%2C" target="_blank">Fanny and Alexander</a></em>, dir: Ingmar Bergman: You may not have heard of this film, and if you have, it's probably been in a context other than "Christmas Story." But I do see this as, broadly, a holiday movie, albeit a very unusual one. It's also very long.

<em><a href="http://video.barnesandnoble.com/DVD/Santa-Claus-Conquers-the-Martians/Pia-Zadora/e/25493162394/?itm=3&amp;USRI=santa+claus+martians" target="_blank">Santa Claus Conquers the Martians</a></em>: I am something of a fan of <em><a href="http://video.barnesandnoble.com/DVD/Mystery-Science-Theater-3000-Essentials/e/603497034420/?itm=2&amp;usri=mystery+science+theater+3000" target="_blank">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a>. </em>I'll admit it here, but nowhere else. That show's outrageous send-up of this obscure, horrible movie from the red-scare days of the 50's is the most lighthearted fun I can think of.

Okay everybody, happy holidays.
