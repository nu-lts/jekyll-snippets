Laura Miller is a great book reviewer for <a href="http://salon.com/" target="_blank">Salon.com</a>, so I was excited to read her thoughts on the changing (and disappearing) landscape of book reviews, and the creation of a new feature: <a href="http://salon.com/books/laura_miller/2009/12/06/what_to_read_intro" target="_blank">What to Read</a>. It's aim is to showcase a recently published book that the writer can genuinely gush over and recommend each week.  I am particularly looking forward to her promise to publicise different genres.

So I was doubly excited that her <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/what_to_read/index.html?story=/books/laura_miller/2009/12/13/logicomix" target="_blank">first profiled book</a> was<em> </em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~/a?searchtype=X&amp;searcharg=logicomix&amp;SORT=D" target="_blank"><em>Logicomix</em></a><em>! </em>Author Christos Papadimitriou spoke at the Library in October. It's a beautiful book (and one that's available at Snell).
