Laura Miller is a great book reviewer for [Salon.com](http://salon.com/), so I was excited to read her thoughts on the changing (and disappearing) landscape of book reviews, and the creation of a new feature: [What to Read](http://salon.com/books/laura_miller/2009/12/06/what_to_read_intro). It's aim is to showcase a recently published book that the writer can genuinely gush over and recommend each week.  I am particularly looking forward to her promise to publicise different genres.

So I was doubly excited that her [first profiled book](http://www.salon.com/books/what_to_read/index.html?story=/books/laura_miller/2009/12/13/logicomix) was_ _[_Logicomix_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~/a?searchtype=X&searcharg=logicomix&SORT=D)_! _Author Christos Papadimitriou spoke at the Library in October. It's a beautiful book (and one that's available at Snell).
