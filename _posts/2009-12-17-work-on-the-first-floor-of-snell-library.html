Work has begun on the first floor with an eyeÂ to removing the old reference desk to make way for a <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=695" target="_blank">new area </a>with seating that focuses on leisure reading, with bestsellers, literary fiction, graphic novels, DVDs, and prize-winning non-fiction all in the same place. (Research assistance is still available, but is now accessible on the second floor of the Library.)

We hope that work will be finished by the time spring semester classes start.
