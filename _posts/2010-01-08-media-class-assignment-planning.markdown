The Digital Media Design Studio works collaboratively with faculty and the Ed Tech Center to effectively design and plan media assignments for non-media majors.

A helpful planning guideline and worksheet are now available on [the DMDS website](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/digital_media/) and "Services for Faculty" [link ](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/digital_media/planning_assignments/)on the Libraries website.
