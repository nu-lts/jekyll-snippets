The Hub is a new fab space for everyone to come hang out in, meet friends, and browse stuff deemed cool and noteworthy by our unbeatable library staff.

Starting Spring 2010 semester, as soon as you walk through the front doors of <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu">Snell Library</a> you'll find a new, better-than-ever browsing collection with selected bestsellers, literary fiction, graphic novels, DVDs, and prize-winning non-fiction all in one central place. We hope this new area becomes your first stop when you need a change of pace or are searching for that special book to challenge you, expand your horizons, or simply entertain you.

The name of this new area was chosen from a pool of over 100 student entries, and the winner, Corina Medley, received a $100 gift certificate donated by the NU Bookstore.

While The Hub will include a selection of the most interesting new books, you can see a full list of every new book coming into the library via our <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/new_titles/"><strong>online New Titles lists</strong></a>.
