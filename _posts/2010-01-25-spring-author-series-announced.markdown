Each semester at the Library we host a diverse group of writers as part of our [Meet the Author series](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/). For me, it's always an interesting opportunity to learn more about a subject I'm interested in, or sometimes one I know very little about. (For [our](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=214) [Fall Football event in 2008](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAYCmJq2YC4&feature=PlayList&p=693D78176FF28E0C&index=28),  I read Mark Bavaro's _[Rough and Tumble](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xrough+and+tumble&SORT=D/Xrough+and+tumble&SORT=D&SUBKEY=rough%20and%20tumble/1%2C11%2C11%2CE/frameset&FF=Xrough+and+tumble&SORT=D&1%2C1%2C), _and came closer to learning what the life of an NFL player is like, adding another layer to watching professional football games). 

This semester is no exception, and there are some great authors who are coming to Northeastern:

**_Sisters in War: A Story of Love, Family, and Survival in the New Iraq_
Christina Asquith
Thursday, January 28 @ 2:30 pm
Alumni Center, 716 Columbus Avenue**

Asquith’s book is the story of four women—two Iraqi sisters, one U.S. soldier, and a U.S. aid worker—whose narratives explain the choices and challenges women face in the new Iraq. Asquith spent from 2003 to 2005 reporting from Baghdad. As a journalist whose living situation grew more imperiled, she moved in with an Iraqi family and gained an intimate look at how the war affected their lives.

**_The Death and Life of American Journalism
_Bob McChesney and John Nichols
Tuesday, February 2 @ Noon
90 Snell Library**

In their new book, communications scholar Bob McChesney and award-winning journalist John Nichols explore the current crisis of journalism. They claim that journalism today can easily be overrun by commercialism and special interests and in many ways has strayed far from its earlier purpose as a tool for public service, made possible by government subsidies. McChesney and Nichols founded the nonprofit Free Press in 2003 with the intention to create a strong, public outlet for journalism. _The Death and Life of American Journalism _makes for riveting reading on public discourse and the informed citizen.

**_Anna In-Between_** **
Elizabeth Nunez
Friday, February 5 @ Noon
421 Snell Library
**
Nunez’s colorful work of fiction focuses on Anna, a successful New York City editor who hails from an upper-class Caribbean family. When Anna returns home, she finds her mother has been diagnosed with breast cancer and has no intentions of traveling to the United States for medical assistance.  Her mother believes that, as a black woman, she will receive inferior medical care.  Throughout the book, Nunez beautifully illustrates the bond between family members and a community.  Nunez is Provost at CUNY’s Medgar Evers College and has written seven novels. 

**_A Tiger’s Heart: A Memoir
_Aisling Shen
Tuesday, February 23 @ 6 pm
405 Ell Hall**

Born in China’s Yangtze River Delta into a community of impoverished rice farmers, Shen was the first person from her village to attend college. Deeply dissatisfied with her government-issued teaching job, she left for the special economic zones of southern China in search of happiness and success in the business world. In 2000 Shen immigrated to the U.S. and graduated magna cum laude from Wellesley College in 2005. She currently works as an equity research associate in an investment management firm in Boston.  In her unflinching memoir, Shen’s personal story also reflects the early days of China’s economic boom and illustrates the massive economic and social changes that have taken place in the country over the past several decades.
