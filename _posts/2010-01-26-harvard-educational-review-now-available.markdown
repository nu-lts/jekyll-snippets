The NU community now has access to the [Harvard Educational Review](http://0-www.metapress.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/content/121179/) online through the NU Libraries.  It's a scholarly journal of opinion and research in education, self-described as "one of the most prestigious journals in education, with circulation to policymakers, researchers, administrators, and teachers."

When I first heard we were getting this journal, I figured it was for education geeks and not for me, but I found a [really interesting and accessible article by Houman Harouni](http://0-www.metapress.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/content/dxxt414m1224j7v1/fulltext.pdf) in the latest issue, on something really relevant to our work here at the NU Libraries.

The article is about the pedagogical problems and opportunities presented by [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org), and how a high-school teacher worked with students to address them.  Should he disparage Wikipedia?  Allow it to be cited?  Vandalize it? Assign students to contribute to it?  Well, a little of all of the above...which led his class to some very interesting understandings of the issue of authorship and scholarly discourse.

I signed up for the rss feed so I get notified when new issues of the journal are published.  Enjoy the Harvard Educational Review...you may be surprised at how relevant it is to your work, too!
