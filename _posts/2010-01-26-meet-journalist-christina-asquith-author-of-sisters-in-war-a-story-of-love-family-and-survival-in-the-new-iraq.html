On Thursday, journalist <a href="http://www.christinaasquith.com/" target="_blank">Christina Asquith</a> is giving a talk and book signing on her accounts<em>, Sisters in War: A Story of Love, Family, and Survival in the New Iraq</em>. Her book is available at <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xasquith&amp;SORT=D/Xasquith&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=asquith/1%2C37%2C37%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xasquith&amp;SORT=D&amp;3%2C3%2C" target="_blank">Snell Library</a>. 

Visiting her <a href="http://www.christinaasquith.com/author/" target="_blank">website</a>,  I was interested to see her experience as education reporter who spent a year teaching in Philadelphia's worst performing school, and then wrote a book about her experience.

Her talk will be held this Thursday, January 28 @ 2:30 pm, in the Alumni Center, 716 Columbus Avenue.
