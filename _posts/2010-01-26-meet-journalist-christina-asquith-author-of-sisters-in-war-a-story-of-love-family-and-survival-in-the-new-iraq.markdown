On Thursday, journalist [Christina Asquith](http://www.christinaasquith.com/) is giving a talk and book signing on her accounts_, Sisters in War: A Story of Love, Family, and Survival in the New Iraq_. Her book is available at [Snell Library](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xasquith&SORT=D/Xasquith&SORT=D&SUBKEY=asquith/1%2C37%2C37%2CE/frameset&FF=Xasquith&SORT=D&3%2C3%2C). 

Visiting her [website](http://www.christinaasquith.com/author/),  I was interested to see her experience as education reporter who spent a year teaching in Philadelphia's worst performing school, and then wrote a book about her experience.

Her talk will be held this Thursday, January 28 @ 2:30 pm, in the Alumni Center, 716 Columbus Avenue.
