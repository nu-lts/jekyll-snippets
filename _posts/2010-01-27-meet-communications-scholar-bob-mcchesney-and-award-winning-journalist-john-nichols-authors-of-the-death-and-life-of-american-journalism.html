<img class="alignright" title="Book Cover" src="http://media.oregonlive.com/books_impact/photo/journjpg-fbb361624dd4feb4_small.jpg" alt="" width="155" height="237" />On Tuesday, February 2, 2010, communications specialist Bob McChesney and journalist John Nichols will be at Northeastern University as part of our <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/">Meet the Author series</a>.

They will be discussing the commercialism and special interests that impact reporting today.  They claim that the art has strayed from its fundamental purpose as a tool for public service and to spread knowledge.  In their <a href="http://www.nationbooks.org/book/200/The%20Death%20and%20Life%20of%20American%20Journalism">book</a> they discuss new methods that can help journalism succeed in today's society.

The book is available at <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xdeath+and+life+of+american+journalism&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=D/Xdeath+and+life+of+american+journalism&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=death%20and%20life%20of%20american%20journalism/1%2C3%2C3%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=Xdeath+and+life+of+american+journalism&amp;searchscope=13&amp;SORT=D&amp;1%2C1%2C">Snell Library</a>.

The authors will be speaking at 90 Snell Library at noon. Refreshments will be served. Download the event flyer <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/RevisedFlyer-2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
