![](http://media.oregonlive.com/books_impact/photo/journjpg-fbb361624dd4feb4_small.jpg)On Tuesday, February 2, 2010, communications specialist Bob McChesney and journalist John Nichols will be at Northeastern University as part of our [Meet the Author series](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/).

They will be discussing the commercialism and special interests that impact reporting today.  They claim that the art has strayed from its fundamental purpose as a tool for public service and to spread knowledge.  In their [book](http://www.nationbooks.org/book/200/The%20Death%20and%20Life%20of%20American%20Journalism) they discuss new methods that can help journalism succeed in today's society.

The book is available at [Snell Library](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xdeath+and+life+of+american+journalism&searchscope=13&SORT=D/Xdeath+and+life+of+american+journalism&searchscope=13&SORT=D&SUBKEY=death%20and%20life%20of%20american%20journalism/1%2C3%2C3%2CE/frameset&FF=Xdeath+and+life+of+american+journalism&searchscope=13&SORT=D&1%2C1%2C).

The authors will be speaking at 90 Snell Library at noon. Refreshments will be served. Download the event flyer [here](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/RevisedFlyer-2.pdf).
