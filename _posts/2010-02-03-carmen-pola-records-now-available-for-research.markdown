The Carmen A. Pola papers are open for research in the [Archives and Special Collections Department](http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/), 92 Snell Library.  [A guide to the collection is available online](http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m159find.htm ). 

Carmen Pola is a community activist who settled in Mission Hill, Boston, in 1972. The materials date from 1970-2006 and document Pola’s work with the Puerto Rican Festival, the Boston Public Schools, the Project to Monitor the Code of Discipline, Mayor Raymond Flynn’s Administration, and Roxbury Unites for Families and Children. The collection includes photographs, correspondence, grant proposals and reports, surveys, charts, organizational records, legal materials, political campaign literature, catalogs, booklets, and meeting minutes.
