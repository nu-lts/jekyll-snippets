Do you use a mobile device for more than just phone calls and texting? If so, we're interested in knowing if you would like to be able to use it for better access to library services.

A very brief survey (4 questions) goes live on the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu">Library home page</a>, so here's your chance to help us decide what would be useful and helpful for your research needs.

Please take a minute to let us know what library information you want to access on your phone or handheld device. The survey is on our home page, or here:
