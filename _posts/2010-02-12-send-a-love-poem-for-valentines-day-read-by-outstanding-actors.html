If you're as sick as I am of hearing about the Valentine's Day roses on WBUR, the Times of London is offering something a little different: Choose from a selection of classic romantic poems, read aloud by what they call a "stellar cast" of actors, to be delivered via e-mail to your sweetie. If he or she loves the plummy tones of Alan Rickman or Patrick Stewart, or the elegance of Helen Mirren, then this could be the perfect gift. Best of all, it's free! (My adoration of Judi Dench is no secret, so I think I'd choose her reading of "How Do I Love Thee" for myself...)

The offer expired on February 14, but you can still listen to poetry at the <a href="http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/home.do" target="_blank">Poetry Archive</a>.
