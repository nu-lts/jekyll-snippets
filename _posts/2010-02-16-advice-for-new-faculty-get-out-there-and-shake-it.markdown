I just read a great blog post on Inside Higher Ed -- ["Get Out There and Shake It!"](http://www.insidehighered.com/advice/winning/winning5) by Kerry Ann Rockquemore. It offers valuable advice to new faculty wanting to make connections at their institution, but I think it's excellent reading for anyone wanting to improve their collegial relationships on campus.

In a nutshell, Rockquemore's advice is, don't wait for people to come to you. Seeking out your colleagues (as the title suggests, getting out there and shaking hands) is a surefire way to make sure you're on their radar as well as improving their impressions of you. It's advice that I needed to hear -- as [Scholarly Communication](http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/scholarly/) Librarian, I definitely need to connect with faculty and help them connect with each other. (So, you can bet you'll be hearing from me soon!)
