Many thanks to all those who participated in our recent survey of mobile devices and what you'd like us to offer on a mobile platform.




Here's what you told us you wanted:




Nucat (80.8%)
Hours (75%)
Renew my books (71%)
Text message (53.8%)
Journal articles (42.3%)




Among the suggestions that people wrote in, only one appeared more than once, and that was "reserve a group study room."  There was only one duplicate among the suggestions: "Reserving a study room"--while there's no online system for doing that, you can call, same day only, 617-373-8778.  




RESPONDENTS:




Altogether we had 52 respondents total.  Undergrad/grad students and library staff participated.  In my view, however, visitors to the library who are not familiar with NU might appreciate being able to get basic access, wireless and lost and found information on their mobile device.  




Most respondents who answered the question about devices are using the blackberry.  I was surprised not to see more i-phones listed, but a lot of people did not answer the question.  




I know it seems like a setup, but we ARE adding a text messaging service to our existing suite of options for contacting a librarian.  You'll hear more about that if you read our blog this week!
