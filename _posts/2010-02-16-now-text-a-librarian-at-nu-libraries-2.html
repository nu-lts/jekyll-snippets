Receive an answer to your library questions via text message through the newest addition to Snell Library Reference Services.   Here’s how:

Send to 66746
Begin your text message with the word <em>husky</em>

Librarians at the research assistance desk will respond as soon as possible. When the desk is closed you will receive an automated response and we will answer your question the next day.

Text a Librarian assigns a random ID number to each question before forwarding it to the library, so your telephone number remains private. There is no charge from the library for the service; however, charges from your cell phone provider may apply.

Text a Librarian is best suited for brief questions that can be answered in a short message. For more detailed reference help, visit the research assistance desk on the second level of Snell Library, use our <a href="http://www.questionpoint.org/crs/servlet/org.oclc.home.TFSRedirect?VIRTCATEGORY=NORTHEASTERN&amp;SS_COMMAND=CUST_SUP&amp;Category=BLC">ASK 24/7</a> online chat service or send us an <a href="../../services/ask_a_librarian/">email. </a>
