“Educate, Inspire, and Celebrate” are the headlines of a lovely display now on view on the First Floor of Snell Library. Colorful posters are surrounded by inspiring quotes commemorating Black History Month. A wide range of information is available including a history of African kings and queens, African Americans in the old West, and black scientists and inventors. There are also posters displaying some of the most influential figures in black history including <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~/a?searchtype=X&amp;searcharg=Ella+Fitzgerald+&amp;SORT=D" target="_blank">Ella Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~/a?searchtype=X&amp;searcharg=Madam+C.J.+Walker&amp;SORT=D&amp;image.x=21&amp;image.y=16" target="_blank">Madam C.J.
