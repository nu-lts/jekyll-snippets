<h3>Family Connection</h3>
"Families are meant to be central to our livesFamilySearch is a service provided by <a href="http://www.mormon.org/" target="_blank">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>. Our commitment to helping people connect with their ancestors is rooted in our beliefs. We believe that families are meant to be central to our lives and that family relationships are intended to continue beyond this life. We therefore believe that all family members—those living, those past, and those future—share an enduring bond that reaches across the generations."

This link below is for DNA test I have not used it and I do not personally know anyone who has.  I thought it would be interesting to add it here to show other possiable ways to connect with family. Their is a test coming out called "Family Finder ." The web site also offers information on other DNA test and you can receive the dna test in the mail. However you do have to pay for the test.
