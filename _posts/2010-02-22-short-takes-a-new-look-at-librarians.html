Over the weekend, I read <a href="http://salon.com/books/nonfiction/index.html?story=/books/feature/2010/02/21/interview_marilyn_johnson_librarians" target="_blank">this interview </a>with Marilyn Johnson, about her new book, <em>This Book Is Overdue!: How Librarians and Cybrarians Can Save Us All. </em>Johnson, author of <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/aJohnson,+Marilyn,+1954-/ajohnson+marilyn+1954/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=ajohnson+marilyn+1954&amp;1%2C1%2C" target="_blank"><em>The Dead Beat</em></a><em>,</em> follows up her chronicle of obituary-writers with an account of librarians. She even mentions book cart drills, which I've learned about from our own Debbie Pennino!

I think librarians and library users might get a kick out of the piece.
