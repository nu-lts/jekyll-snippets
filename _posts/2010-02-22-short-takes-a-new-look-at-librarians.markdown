Over the weekend, I read [this interview ](http://salon.com/books/nonfiction/index.html?story=/books/feature/2010/02/21/interview_marilyn_johnson_librarians)with Marilyn Johnson, about her new book, _This Book Is Overdue!: How Librarians and Cybrarians Can Save Us All. _Johnson, author of [_The Dead Beat_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/aJohnson,+Marilyn,+1954-/ajohnson+marilyn+1954/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FF=ajohnson+marilyn+1954&1%2C1%2C)_,_ follows up her chronicle of obituary-writers with an account of librarians. She even mentions book cart drills, which I've learned about from our own Debbie Pennino!

I think librarians and library users might get a kick out of the piece.
