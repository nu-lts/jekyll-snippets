Congratulations to our friends and colleagues from across Forsyth Street...the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/law/library/" target="_blank">NU School of Law Library</a>! Following on the beautiful new renovations to their digs in the Asa Knowles building, the Library at the NU School of Law now has a <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/law/library/">beautiful new web site</a>, too.

A lot of the old familiar elements are there: the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/law/library/news/legalnews.html" target="_blank">blog feed from the Jurist</a> at the University of Pittsburgh, for example, the <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search" target="_blank">NuCat search</a>, and and all their helpful guides and links.

Plus, everything is grouped on the home page a little more clearly, and the colors and pictures make the site quite beautiful. It's really inspiring to us, as we begin a similar process of redesigning our web site here at Snell!
