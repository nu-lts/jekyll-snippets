[![law library](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/lawlibrary.gif)](http://www.northeastern.edu/law/library)

Congratulations to our friends and colleagues from across Forsyth Street...the [NU School of Law Library](http://www.northeastern.edu/law/library/)! Following on the beautiful new renovations to their digs in the Asa Knowles building, the Library at the NU School of Law now has a [beautiful new web site](http://www.northeastern.edu/law/library/), too.

A lot of the old familiar elements are there: the [blog feed from the Jurist](http://www.northeastern.edu/law/library/news/legalnews.html) at the University of Pittsburgh, for example, the [NuCat search](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search), and and all their helpful guides and links.

Plus, everything is grouped on the home page a little more clearly, and the colors and pictures make the site quite beautiful. It's really inspiring to us, as we begin a similar process of redesigning our web site here at Snell!
