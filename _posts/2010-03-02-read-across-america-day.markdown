Today, March 2, is [Read Across America day](http://www.nea.org/grants/13003.htm), organized by the National Education Association, and celebrated on Dr. Seuss's birthday. The idea behind it is "for every child to be reading in the company of a caring adult."

Interested students at Northeastern can join organizations like [Jumpstart](http://www.northeastern.edu/communityservice/americorps/jumpstart.html) on campus that are devoted to early childhood literacy.

At the Library, we have a number of [Dr. Seuss books in the Favat Children's Collection](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S5/?searchtype=X&searcharg=seuss&searchscope=15&sortdropdown=-&SORT=DZ&extended=1&SUBMIT=Search&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=Xseuss%26SORT%3DD), as well as [biographies ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S15/?searchtype=d&searcharg=seuss&searchscope=5&sortdropdown=-&SORT=DZ&extended=1&SUBMIT=Search&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=Xseuss%26SORT%3DDZ)of the Massachusetts-born writer, and even a [government document](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S5?/Xseuss&searchscope=5&SORT=D/Xseuss&searchscope=5&SORT=D&SUBKEY=seuss/1%2C89%2C89%2CE/frameset&FF=Xseuss&searchscope=5&SORT=D&7%2C7%2C#)--[a 1943 army piece illustrated by Seuss about the perils of mosquitos!](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S5?/Xseuss&searchscope=5&SORT=D/Xseuss&searchscope=5&SORT=D&SUBKEY=seuss/1%2C89%2C89%2CE/frameset&FF=Xseuss&searchscope=5&SORT=D&7%2C7%2C#)
