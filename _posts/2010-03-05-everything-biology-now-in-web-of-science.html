NU researchers already know about Web of Knowledge, the mega-database from the Institute for Scientific Information that's linked to the Journal Citation Reports.  Often used for broad searching and citation tracking, Web of Knowledge through the NU Libraries now goes much deeper with the addition of BIOSIS Previews, the premier journal article database in biology.

The NU Libraries have always offered BIOSIS; in fact, it was the very first online service that we ever licensed on the web, back in the palmy 1990's when home was a haven from library research, and every other database had to be searched on a CD-ROM network on the first floor of Snell Library.

Now we are shifting BIOSIS from the Ovid platform to Web of Knowledge.  With this change, you can search BIOSIS with numerous other journal citation databases across and beyond the sciences.  BIOSIS adds more international coverage to Web of Science, and it includes patents.  We hope this will be a real boon for interdisciplinary research.  Search "extraterrestrial life" and find scholarship from astronomy journals, journals in meteorology, astrobiology, medical sociology, and philosophy all in the same results set.   Indexing goes back to 1969.  <a title="BIOSIS via Web of Knowledge" href="http://0-isiknowledge.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu" target="_blank">Try BIOSIS</a> and experience these expanded search results for yourself!
