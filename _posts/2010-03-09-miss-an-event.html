For those of you who haven't caught on, Northeastern University Libraries sponsors at least one <a title="Library News &amp; Events page" href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/" target="_blank">event</a> every month, from Meet the Author visits to  presentations by a successful alum. Though there's nothing quite like sitting in front of a journalist-turned-author speaking about her experiences in Afghanistan or watching the tears fall down your neighbor's face in reaction to a philosopher's jokes about life and death, fear not! Technology has you covered if you missed an event.

In addition to the <a title="NU Libraries on iTunes" href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/facts_statistics/around_the_web/itunes/" target="_blank">iTunes U</a> and <a title="NU Libraries on YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=693D78176FF28E0C" target="_blank">YouTube University</a> accounts, the library also has a <a title="NU Libraries on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/northeastern_university_libraries/" target="_blank">Flickr page</a> that allows you to scroll through events in a matter of seconds. As the Library Events Photographer, I urge you to check out this page and the <a title="photos on Snell Snippets" href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?page_id=6" target="_blank">Snippets Gallery</a>, both of which feature the authors you may not have had the opportunity to see in person.

In the glorious age of technology, it's almost a sin to fall behind. Happy browsing!
