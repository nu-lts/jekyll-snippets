For those of you who haven't caught on, Northeastern University Libraries sponsors at least one [event](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/) every month, from Meet the Author visits to  presentations by a successful alum. Though there's nothing quite like sitting in front of a journalist-turned-author speaking about her experiences in Afghanistan or watching the tears fall down your neighbor's face in reaction to a philosopher's jokes about life and death, fear not! Technology has you covered if you missed an event.

In addition to the [iTunes U](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/facts_statistics/around_the_web/itunes/) and [YouTube University](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=693D78176FF28E0C) accounts, the library also has a [Flickr page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/northeastern_university_libraries/) that allows you to scroll through events in a matter of seconds. As the Library Events Photographer, I urge you to check out this page and the [Snippets Gallery](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?page_id=6), both of which feature the authors you may not have had the opportunity to see in person.

In the glorious age of technology, it's almost a sin to fall behind. Happy browsing!
