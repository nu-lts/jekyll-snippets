Author and columnist Steven Goldman is a member of the legendary baseball think tank _Baseball Prospectus_, which runs a website and releases an annual publication, a smorgasbord of statistics, analysis, predictions and insight perfect for any true-blooded baseball fan. Known for his witty writing style, he writes the popular "You Could Look It Up" column during baseball season. His other books include 2004’s _Mind Game_, about the Red Sox and their journey to the World Series, and 2007's _It Ain't Over Till It's Over_. He will be joined by his _Baseball Prospectus_ colleagues, Kevin Goldstein and Marc Normandin.

_"Baseball Prospectus has become the standard by which all scouting guides should be measured."_-– Billy Beane, General Manager, Oakland A's
