Today we launch our 2010 library quality survey, LibQual!

Continuing until April 9, you have the perfect opportunity to share with us your thoughts on the Library by taking the LibQUAL+® survey.  

Help us to make the library a better place, physically and online, by taking 5-10 minutes to complete the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/libqual/" target="_blank">LibQual survey here</a>.

We do this survey every 3 years, and every time it helps us find out how to make our services better for you. There is a lot of information about how the survey works on our <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/libqual_faq/" target="_blank">LibQual FAQ</a>.

This year we also offer great prizes: An Amazon Kindle E-book reader, four $100 gift certificates to the NU Bookstore, and thirty-five $10 gift cards to Dunkin Donuts!

Year-round, we listen to your comments and suggestions and try to act on them. A high rate of participation in the LibQUAL+® survey will help us be sure that we are focusing on the concerns and suggestions of a truly representative sample of our graduate and undergraduate students,   faculty, and staff users. 

The Library listened to your comments after the 2004 and 2007 survey results and made these specific improvements: extended Library hours; added more tables on the first floor and more attractive study areas like the Hub; simplified and improved the Library website; and subscribed to the <em>Web of Science</em> database. Shortly, we will be adding a substantial number of electrical outlets for laptop users.
