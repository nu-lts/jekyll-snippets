We've seen your emails. We've heard you tell us at the Circulation Desk. We've read your notes on the suggestion board. We know what you want: OUTLETS!!!

So thanks to the Provost's Office and University Facilities, we are in a whirlwind of wire-pulling and outlet-creation here at Snell Library. Between now and finals, we will be adding <em><strong>several hundred outlets</strong></em> to all the study floors of Snell Library.

We're thrilled to be able to provide what we know everyone who brings a laptop, notebook, phone, camera, and scanner really needs in order to get work done. Power to the people![caption id="attachment_1243" align="alignleft" width="450" caption="Enjoy the quad outlets, coming soon to a table near you!
