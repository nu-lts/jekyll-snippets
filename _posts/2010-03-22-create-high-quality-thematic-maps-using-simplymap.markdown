From [trial](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=683) to [subscription](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/simplymap/index.php)! The Library is pleased to announce the acquisition of SimplyMap, a web-based application that enables one to create high quality thematic maps, charts, and reports based on extensive demographic, business, marketing, and health data.

SimplyMap tools allow you to compare data across different geographical locations, down to the block group level. Included are variables such as ethnicity, transportation, language, housing, population, education, employment, and consumer expenditures. 

The data also includes estimates and projections so that you can analyze and plot current and future trends. SimplyMap also includes SimmonsLOCAL, a tool that tracks consumer behavior through over 200 media markets and includes over 450 product categories and 8,000 specific brands.
