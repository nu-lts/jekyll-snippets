This is a reminder for all faculty members that Reserve requests for Summer I are due by April 16th. Requests for Summer II are due by May 31st. Please submit all reserve requests by these dates in order to ensure that items are on Reserve by the start of each term. You can submit a request by filling out the electronic form under the Library tab at [MyNEU](http://myneu.neu.edu) or by turning in a manual request form, which is available at the Circulation Desk in the Library. If you would like to request an item for Reserves that is not currently in the library's collection, please see the [Reserve purchasing policy](http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/course_reserves/documents/TextbooksCourseReserves.pdf). If you have any questions, please contact Stephanie Knutson at s.knutson@neu.edu.
