Interested in the future of Medicaid? Intergenerational issues? The health and psychology of aging?

Newly available from the Libraries is a search tool called <a href="http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?uthtype=ip,uid&profile=ehost&defaultdb=gnh">Ageline</a>. <a href="http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?uthtype=ip,uid&profile=ehost&defaultdb=gnh">Ageline</a> is produced by AARP and is now one of the Libraries' best resources for coverage of social gerontology.

Particularly timely at this historic moment-- in which we are witnessing the passage of the new Health Care Reform law-- it covers public policy and the delivery of health care for the population aged 50+.

<span><em>Â </em></span>A truly interdisciplinary database, it will prove useful to students of psychology, behavioral sciences, human services, geriatric nursing, anthropology, sociology, and business, as well as others.

An example of an article I found here (which happened to be full text, thanks to the Libraries' subscription to the journal <em>Social Science and Medicine</em>) is "<a href="http://0-web.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/ehost/viewarticle?data=dGJyMPPp44rp2%2fdV0%2bnjisfk5Ie46bNItae0S7Sk63nn5Kx95uXxjL6prUqzpbBIr6aeTbipsFKuqZ5oy5zyit%2fk8Xnh6ueH7N%2fiVauqsU6zqLdMt6mkhN%2fk5VXj5KR84LPlhuac8nnls79mpNfsVcPGskivp7RRsa2kfu3o63nys%2bSN6uLyffbq&amp;hid=106">The influence of national policy change on subnational policymaking: Medicaid nursing facility reimbursement in the American states.</a>"
