Interested in the future of Medicaid? Intergenerational issues? The health and psychology of aging?

Newly available from the Libraries is a search tool called [Ageline](http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?uthtype=ip,uid&profile=ehost&defaultdb=gnh). [Ageline](http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?uthtype=ip,uid&profile=ehost&defaultdb=gnh) is produced by AARP and is now one of the Libraries' best resources for coverage of social gerontology.

Particularly timely at this historic moment-- in which we are witnessing the passage of the new Health Care Reform law-- it covers public policy and the delivery of health care for the population aged 50+.

_Â _A truly interdisciplinary database, it will prove useful to students of psychology, behavioral sciences, human services, geriatric nursing, anthropology, sociology, and business, as well as others.

An example of an article I found here (which happened to be full text, thanks to the Libraries' subscription to the journal _Social Science and Medicine_) is "[The influence of national policy change on subnational policymaking: Medicaid nursing facility reimbursement in the American states.](http://0-web.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/ehost/viewarticle?data=dGJyMPPp44rp2%2fdV0%2bnjisfk5Ie46bNItae0S7Sk63nn5Kx95uXxjL6prUqzpbBIr6aeTbipsFKuqZ5oy5zyit%2fk8Xnh6ueH7N%2fiVauqsU6zqLdMt6mkhN%2fk5VXj5KR84LPlhuac8nnls79mpNfsVcPGskivp7RRsa2kfu3o63nys%2bSN6uLyffbq&hid=106)"

Those who are interested in [Ageline](http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?uthtype=ip,uid&profile=ehost&defaultdb=gnh) might also want to check out the [Geriatrics and Gerontology](http://subjectguides.lib.neu.edu/geriatrics_gerontology) subject guide and [Human Services](http://subjectguides.lib.neu.edu/human_services) subject guide.
