The Library has just added <a href="http://0-jazz.alexanderstreet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/" target="_blank">Alexander Street Press' Jazz Music Library collection</a> of 4,974 albums and 60,553 tracks to our media streaming repertoire.

Sample its many artists and genres and set up your own play list. Listen to Deval Patrick's father Pat play sax on "Come Rain or Shine" or hear Ella Fitzgerald sing "720 in the Books."

Enjoy!
