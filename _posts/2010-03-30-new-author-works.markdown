Like many universities, Northeastern has the benefit of having among its faculty a number of published professors. Northeastern University Libraries is celebrating this year's group of published works with a book cover display on the first floor of Snell. On the reverse of the sign are pamphlets with more information about the authors and books, which we encourage you to pick up and pass on. The hard work that went into these pieces truly deserves our recognition.
