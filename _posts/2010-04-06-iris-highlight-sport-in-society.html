In addition to its academic departments, Northeastern University hosts multiple interdisciplinary <a title="NU page of research centers" href="http://www.northeastern.edu/research/centers_institutes/" target="_blank">research centers and institutes</a>. These centers are the source of a great deal of original research. Many of them have chosen to place their publications and presentations in <a title="go to IRis" href="http://iris.lib.neu.edu" target="_blank">IRis</a>, the Libraries’ digital archive that collects, manages, preserves, and shares the intellectual output and historical record of Northeastern University.

One such center is <a title="go to Sport in Society site" href="http://www.northeastern.edu/sportinsociety/" target="_blank">Sport in Society</a>, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. This center conducts research and offers programming and outreach with a mission of using the power and appeal of sport to foster diversity, prevent violence, and improve the health of local and global communities.

Sport in Society has submitted an extensive <a title="Sport in Society's IRis collections" href="http://iris.lib.neu.edu/sport/" target="_blank">set of reports, presentations, and research articles</a> to IRis.
