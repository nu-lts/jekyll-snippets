In addition to its academic departments, Northeastern University hosts multiple interdisciplinary [research centers and institutes](http://www.northeastern.edu/research/centers_institutes/). These centers are the source of a great deal of original research. Many of them have chosen to place their publications and presentations in [IRis](http://iris.lib.neu.edu), the Libraries’ digital archive that collects, manages, preserves, and shares the intellectual output and historical record of Northeastern University.

One such center is [Sport in Society](http://www.northeastern.edu/sportinsociety/), which is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. This center conducts research and offers programming and outreach with a mission of using the power and appeal of sport to foster diversity, prevent violence, and improve the health of local and global communities.

Sport in Society has submitted an extensive [set of reports, presentations, and research articles](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/sport/) to IRis. You can read about [athletes with disabilities and their legal rights to participate in recreational and sporting opportunities](http://hdl.handle.net/2047/d10009802), or about [violence linked to teams or universities with Native American mascots](http://hdl.handle.net/2047/d10010099), among many other topics.

[Browse in IRis](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/communities.html) and you can find out about the fascinating array of subjects being studied by Sport in Society and many of Northeastern’s other research centers.
