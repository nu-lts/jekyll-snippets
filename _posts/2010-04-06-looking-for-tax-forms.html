It's that time of year again, when we all hope that April showers will bring May tax refunds.  

<strong>If you're looking for Massachusetts state tax forms</strong>, we have a supply of paper forms on a table next to <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=815">the Hub</a> on the first floor of Snell Library.  



<strong>For federal forms,</strong> connect to <a href="http://www.irs.treas.gov/formspubs/index.html">the IRS web site.</a>

<strong>If you need to file in another state</strong>, forms for all 50 states can be found at the <a href="http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/link/forms.html">web site of the Federation of Tax Administrators</a>.

<b>Residents of eastern Massachusetts may be eligible to extend the deadline to file to May 11 </b>.  The extension is intended to ease the burden on those among us who are still coping with the effects of flooding.
