It's not just faculty and graduate students who are doing research at Northeastern. Undergraduates at NU are doing some interesting stuff. (Talk to your professor to find out how you can get involved in [undergraduate research](http://www.northeastern.edu/cas/experiential/ur-howitworks.html) at NU.)

At the Library, we are trying to capture as much of the university output as possible through [IRis](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/), and that includes undergraduate research and projects done through the Honors Program.

Here are some interesting Honors Projects of undergraduates from past years that are currently in [IRis](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/):

[Drugs versus psychotherapy, which would you choose? : a cognitive investigation of a clinical problem](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/honors_projects/14), by Jennelle E. Yopchick.

[Introduction to linguistics study guide](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/honors_projects/23), Laura E. Hughes and Anna Gartsman

[One insider's view of the research process](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/honors_projects/33), Wendy Lewis Kesl.   This student describes her experience participating in a study of nurses and nursing students in England.

If you are in the Honors Program or doing undergraduate research yourself, we hope to get your final project to put into [IRis](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/).
