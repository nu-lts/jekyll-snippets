Last July we had a lively and thought provoking discussion about <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=288" target="_blank">Censorship and the Library</a> as a follow up to that discussion I thought I would post a link to the <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/newspresscenter/news/pressreleases2010/april2010/mostchallenged2009_oif.cfm" target="_self">ALA Top Ten list of most frequently challenged books for 2009</a>. What I find interesting is that the popular Twilight series of books has been added to the list. It seems that the challenges are theme based rather then content based for this series of books. The majority of these books are works of fiction which are challenged because they offend values of the complaining individuals. So the question that all this raises (again) is: should offended individuals prevent others from having general access to works of literature, art, music or film because they may have controversial themes or content? In my opinion taking the time to attempt to censor a particular work just calls attention to it and rather then removing the offending work from general circulation it just promotes that work to those who may indeed find it to be influential. Which is contrary the intent of the censors.
