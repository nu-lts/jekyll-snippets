To celebrate [Earth Week](http://earthweek.us/), Snell Library is participating in a campus-wide electronics waste collection effort.

If you have old chargers, hair dryers, lamps, plugs, cords or other electronics (not phones) please bring them to the collection box on the Circulation Desk in the lobby of Snell Library.

For questions about what items are eligible, contact Carol Rosskam, NU Sustainability Program Manager, at 617.373.8730, 617.828.2505 (cell) or c.rosskam@neu.edu.

Find out more about e-waste collection on the [Sustainability@NU ](http://www.northeastern.edu/sustainability/events/)web site.
