Dr. Sanders was recently named one of America`s Top 21 Women`s Doctors by LifeScript.com, the #1 website for women`s health. Before going to medical school Sanders was an Emmy award winning producer for CBS News. Her most recent book was _[Every Patient Tells a Story: Medical Mysteries and the Art of Diagnosis](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/aSanders,+Lisa,+1956-/asanders+lisa+1956/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FF=asanders+lisa+1956&1%2C1%2C)_.
