Founded by the Northeastern University English Department and published for over three decades, <a href="http://iris.lib.neu.edu/saf/" target="_blank"><em>Studies in American Fiction</em></a> is a well-regarded, peer-reviewed journal that covers both "emergent writers and canons, as well as American literary classics." IRis has a small selection of recent articles, and will hopefully include more backfiles in the future.
