Founded by the Northeastern University English Department and published for over three decades, [_Studies in American Fiction_](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/saf/) is a well-regarded, peer-reviewed journal that covers both "emergent writers and canons, as well as American literary classics." IRis has a small selection of recent articles, and will hopefully include more backfiles in the future.

In _Studies in American Fiction_ you can find articles on authors as diverse as [John Cheever](http://hdl.handle.net/2047/d10016661), [Jonathan Safran Foer](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/saf_35_2/2/), and [Sarah Orne Jewett](http://hdl.handle.net/2047/d10018335), and on topics as diverse as [missionary literature](http://hdl.handle.net/2047/d10017616), [Orientalism](http://hdl.handle.net/2047/d10018323), and [temperance](http://hdl.handle.net/2047/d10018311).

IRis also includes additional contributions from the [Northeastern English Department](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/english/), and you can even [browse in IRis](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/communities.html) for more exposure to the fascinating array of subjects being studied by Northeasternâ€™s other departments and research centers.
