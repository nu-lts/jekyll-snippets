[RILM Abstracts of Music Literature](http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?authtype=ip,uid&profile=ehost&defaultdb=rih) from Ebscohost is the NU Libraries' latest web resource in the humanities. Musicologists, ethnomusicologists, educators, psychologists, and anyone else interested in music research will enjoy using RILM to search for journal articles, dissertations, books, and much more on music topics.

RILM makes a nice pairing with some of our new music streaming services like the [Jazz Music Library](http://0-jazz.alexanderstreet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/) and [Database of Recorded American Music](http://0-www.dramonline.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/search).  Doing research on the flugelhorn?  Listen to it in [Jazz Music Library](http://0-jazz.alexanderstreet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/) and learn more about it in [RILM](http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?authtype=ip,uid&profile=ehost&defaultdb=rih).  Need recently published research on a [DRAM](http://0-www.dramonline.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/search) recording of the music of Ruth Crawford Seeger?  Find journal articles about her in [RILM](http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?authtype=ip,uid&profile=ehost&defaultdb=rih).

Like our other abstract databases, RILM is connected to the library's full text journal subscriptions, and to our interlibrary loan system, ILLiad, for ordering items not available in our print or online collections.  RSS feeds and alerts are also available.

[Find RILM](http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?uthtype=ip,uid&profile=ehost&defaultdb=rih) through the library's ["Articles"](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles) database list, or right-click (Mac:control-click) and bookmark this URL:
