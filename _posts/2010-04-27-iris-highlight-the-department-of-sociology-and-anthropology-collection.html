The Sociology and Anthropology Department here at Northeastern University is staffed by the most amazing faculty on the planet, for example: Michael Brown Ph.D., Professor in Theory, Cultural Sociology, History of Sociology/Social Thought; and Jack Levin Ph.D., Professor in Criminology, Prejudice, Social Psychology, Aging/Social Gerontology.

It is no wonder that the graduates of this program mirror the excellence of their professors; for example, Katherine Rickenbacker, Stanislav Vysotsky, Peter P. Cassino, Janese Lynette, and Marci Lee Gerulis-Darcy. Check out their disserations and master’s thesis now easily viewable and readily available on <a href="http://iris.lib.neu.edu/" target="_blank">IRis</a>. Simply browse “collections,” scroll down to Department of Sociology and Anthropology, or <a href="http://iris.lib.neu.edu/soc_anth/" target="_blank">click here</a>.
