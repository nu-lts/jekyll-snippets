Michael Denham, a sophomore at NU, is the winner of our grand prize, an Amazon Kindle E-book reader, for completing the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/libqual">LibQual survey</a>.

Michael's name was drawn from over 2500 people who were kind enough to take the time to respond to our survey. Michael had recently purchased a Kindle for his father and was thrilled to be able to have one of his own!

Gift certificates from the NU Bookstore and Dunkin Donuts were also awarded to 40 randomly selected participants in the survey.

Our response to the LibQual survey has been wonderful. We are pleased that 7.8% of all undergraduates responded, 9.3% of graduate students, and 10.1% of all faculty took the time to tell us about your experiences and expectations are for the libraries at Northeastern. We'll be publishing more details about the survey results on our web site and in this blog. Thank you so much for your participation!
