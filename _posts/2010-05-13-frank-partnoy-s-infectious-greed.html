Balzaac's saying (check source) [<a title="Edit section: Le Père Goriot (1835)" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7">edit</a>] <em>Le Père Goriot</em>

<em>Le secret des grandes fortunes sans cause apparente est un crime oublié, parce qu'il a été proprement fait.</em>
<ul>
	<li>The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been found out, because it was properly executed.</li>
</ul>
"Behind every great fortune is a crime" is amply proved in Frank Partnoy's sharp indictment, <em>Infectious Greed</em>. The book was published in 2003, and I was motivated to read it in the wake of the financial crisis, by the reprint of this review in Salon. (link) 

Partnoy's book is long,

This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/business/13lehman.html?hp" target="_blank">recent NY Times article </a>about Lehman Brothers' use of a shadow altar ego company underscores that this is still a relatively current practice.

And <a href="http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/judgments/2010/04/16/its-not-just-goldman-its-clients?page=full" target="_blank">Goldman Sachs</a>

Partnoy's recommendations:
<ol>
	<li>Treat derivatives like other financial instruments</li>
	<li>Shift from rules to standards</li>
	<li>Eliminate the oligopoly lock of gatekeepers, especially credit-rating agencies</li>
	<li>Prosecute complex financial fraud</li>
	<li>Encourage informed investors to bet against stocks (maybe also mention the dangers--ie. what Paulson is doing)</li>
	<li>Encourage investors to control and monitor their own investments</li>
</ol>
