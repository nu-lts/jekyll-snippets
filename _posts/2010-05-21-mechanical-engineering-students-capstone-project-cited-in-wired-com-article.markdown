On March 9, 2010, the popular website Wired.com published an article titled "[Mile-High Mega Kites Could Pull Giant, Floating Power Plants](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/03/hydro-paraplant/)," by author Alexis Madrigal.  Madrigal cited the work of six NU students, and included a link to their capstone project, which had been published in [IRis, Northeastern's digital archive of scholarship](http://iris.lib.neu.edu).

In the past 2 months, their capstone project, "Hydroelectric Power Generator: Technical Design Report," which the students created in the course MIME1501 in May 2002, has been viewed 350 times by readers of the Wired article.  Congratulations to student authors Anthony Chesna, Tony DiBella, Tim Hutchins, Saralyn Kropf, Jeff Lesica, and Jim Mahoney!
