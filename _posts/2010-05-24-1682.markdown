Come to the DMDS to see the photographs of Sierra Smith, Journalism, '14.

This video highlights most of the photographs in the show.



Curated by DMDS co-op Abigail Ochse, Digital Arts, '12, this exhibit displays an expressive potpourri of vibrant images covering a range of subjects.

**Regarding her creativity, Sierra Smith wrote:**
“I don't know if I've been working long enough to develop a style, but my work does tend toward the artistic, rather than the journalistic. It's often fairly colorful, too. Though I would say I'm pleased with my portfolio, it's been mostly limited by my camera; I've been using the same one for years, and it's not exactly something a photographer would flaunt. Because of its quality, my work is often narrowed into a single style. However, it also forces me to compensate by looking for things that another photographer with better equipment may not see. While he's letting the camera dictate his photograph, I'm letting my artistic vision do the honor.”

Come see the show in person through the summer. If you are interested in exhibiting your work in the DMDS next fall, please[ contact Debra Mandel](mailto:d.mandel@neu.edu.)
