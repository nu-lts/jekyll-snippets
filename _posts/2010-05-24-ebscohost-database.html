You may be familiar with EBSCOhost, the face of many of the library's article databases. Now we are trying out a new concept in search: the <a href="http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?authtype=ip,uid&amp;profile=eds" target="_blank">EBSCO Discovery Service</a> (EDS), and we hope you will help us evaluate it. The hallmarks of EDS are speed and simplicity. EDS provides a starting point for your research, an easy keyword search across multiple databases, including the library catalog, article databases and more, returning a list of results that points to articles from academic journals, magazines, newspapers, books, book chapters, video, music and more. With EDS it is easy to see what sources your results are coming from so that you can continue your search in the individual databases if you wish. The EBSCO Discovery Service is a product in progress, and that is why your input is so important. Features will be enhanced and content added as we work with the vendor to develop the service.

Please check back as progress continues on the EDS and leave feedback on this blog, or use the feedback form that is linked on the <a href="http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?authtype=ip,uid&amp;profile=eds" target="_blank">EDS main search page</a>.
