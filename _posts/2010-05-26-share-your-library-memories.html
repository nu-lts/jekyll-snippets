NU Libraries has employed many students and graduates throughout the years. Please share your memories of working in the Library, no matter what year you graduated, by posting a comment under this post.

As a recent graduate myself, I'll start: I highly enjoyed the visit of Patrick Tracey, who came to give a Meet the Author talk in April of 2009. His book <em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2209915~S13" target="_blank" title="NUCAT listing for this book">Stalking Irish Madness</a></em> is an unsettling account of his family's long history of schizophrenia, which in turn relates to the prevalence of mental illness all over the country of Ireland. His talk-- like his book-- was partly autobiographical and partly journalistic. There was something powerful about listening to this world-weary looking guy, with a monotone sort of voice that still managed to convey compassion, while looking out the window at the sun setting over the smokestack at a nearby building, blowing fumes into the air...

As minute and eccentric as it may seem, that is a very special memory of mine from working at the library.
