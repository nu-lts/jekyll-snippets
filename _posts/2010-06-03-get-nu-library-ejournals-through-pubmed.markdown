**Are you a researcher in the Health Sciences?** If so, you're probably a fan of [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?otool=manoeulib), the National Library of Medicine's famous database of journal articles.

A recent law requires NIH-funded researchers to deposit their full articles in PubMed, but not all medical research is funded by NIH.  So unless you're on the NU campus network using library subscriptions, most complete articles still require a fee.

**To the rescue... a special [PubMed @ NU](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?otool=manoeulib)** URL with our NU Library links:[ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?otool=manoeulib](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?otool=manoeulib)

Now, do a search and every article will have a little button that looks like this:
[![""](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/checkFullTextPubmed.gif)](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/checkFullTextPubmed.gif)

Click the button:


_If the NU Libraries subscribe_ to the journal, the full text will appear,
or,
_If we don't subscribe_ to the journal, you'll get a choice of Google Scholar or ILLiad. Try Google Scholar for a free version, otherwise click "Request this article as a .pdf" from ILLiad. We'll deliver you a free .pdf, usually in one business day!

**What if you forget Northeastern's special URL!?! **
Save this blog post!  Or set up a myNCBI account (free, and with some other benefits like the ability to save your work) set your preference to "Northeastern University Libraries" as an "Outside Tool."  This will give you the same NU Library ejournal links and Interlibrary ILLiad option.

So if you're at home, and you want access to our ejournals in PubMed, try [PubMed @ NU](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?otool=manoeulib).  You won't believe how easy it is!
