In <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/northeasterncreates/gallery360/" target="_blank">gallery 360</a>, an travelling art exhibit on the <a href="http://www.negroleaguebaseball.com/" target="_blank">Negro League baseball </a>teams of the 20's, 30's and 40's is currently on display. The display, titled "Shades of Greatness," is a combination of oils, mixed media, photography and sculpture. The works highlight the importance of the Negro Leagues in African American culture.

This exhibit may be considered a larger extension of the small display that can be seen on the first floor of the library. (See the blog post on that display <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=1724&amp;cpage=1#comment-1876" target="_blank">here</a>).

The exhibit has been up since May 17th and will close on July 23rd. Gallery hours are Monday to Friday, 10am to 7pm. If you would like to schedule a group tour with <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/latino/contactus.html" target="_blank">LSCC</a>, please contact <a href="mailto:LSCC@neu.edu">LSCC@neu.edu</a> or call 617-373-5845.
