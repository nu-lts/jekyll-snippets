Our summer reading display is up. Go to the lobby and check out the large display case. All the visuals and designs are courtesy of Krissy Lattanzio.

I still am debating putting some actual books up in the case, but not every book mentioned. I feel this would help grab people's attention and make the display jump out. So there may be more to come.
