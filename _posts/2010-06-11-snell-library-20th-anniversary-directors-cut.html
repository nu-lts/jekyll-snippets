Want to be a library star?

This year marks the 20th anniversary of <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/" target="_blank">Snell Library</a>, and we intend to celebrate. At the epicenter of our celebrations will be a web video that we need your help with. We’re inviting all current NU students who love the library for an on-camera interview this summer as part of the project. We want to  talk to you about what makes the library special and why you keep coming back.

This could be you. Please contact Programming and Communications Comittee chair Tom Urell at <a href="mailto:t.urell@neu.edu">t.urell@neu.edu</a> or 617-373-8346. Please keep in mind that this project is still in development, so we may not be able to answer all questions as of now.

Thanks, and we hope to hear from you!
