Hi Visitors,

As you may have noticed, the Naxos post was taken down. This is because there seem to be some problems with getting the Naxos iPhone app to work. Both Karen Meguerian and Debra Mandel have informed me of this issue, and so until we find out exactly what one must do to get the iPhone application on to their itunes, we are withholding this post. Expect a revision soon.

Thank you.
