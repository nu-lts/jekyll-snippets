<em>Note: This is the definitive version of the Naxos post, with full instructions</em>.

Are you a fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bach">Bach</a>? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Friedrich_Handel" target="_blank">Handel</a>? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debussy" target="_blank">Debussy</a>? You should check out <a href="http://www.naxosmusiclibrary.com/home.asp?rurl=%2Fdefault%2Easp" target="_blank">Naxos</a>, one of our many Alumni Resources at Snell. It is a music library  tailored towards fans of Classical Music.

 If you go to the Naxos website (<a href="http://www.naxosmusiclibrary.com/">www.naxosmusiclibrary.com</a>) you can find such a wide array of composers and songs (over 615,000 songs), that you might feel overwhelmed, but there is no need to worry; Naxos organizes itself in to categories of Composers, Genres and a search engine for specific song titles.

Although Naxos is, ostensibly, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music" target="_blank">Classical Music</a>  site,  the site is now expanding to other genres. An impressive Jazz collection has been established, categrorized under both "Contemporary Jazz" and "Jazz Greats."

 There is a new application Naxos has recently started; now you can upload music on to your <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone</a>, iPad or iTouch. First you must register with Naxos, then you may begin streaming playlists on to your phone. You can create your own playlists.

Students (users) have the ability to create a student playlist account and build their own, private playlists. To do this, they need to access the NML as usual, click on the Playlist tab at the top of the page, then click "Sign-up."To register for Naxos, you must vist <a href="http://0-neu.naxosmusiclibrary.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu" target="_blank">http://0-neu.naxosmusiclibrary.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/</a>  (if you are off-campus, use myNEU credentials to log in). Click on the Playlist tab, then click "Sign Up." (If nothing happens the first time you click, click again).  The user will be asked to enter his/her name, email address, and to create a password. Once (s)he has created a student playlist account, (s)he will be able to login to the account and build an unlimited number of playlists from any piece within the Naxos Music Library. (Playlists are limited to 60 tracks or 4 hours--whichever comes first--for loading and streaming optimization.) The same login will be used for both the student playlist account AND the iPhone app. While the NML app version 2.0 allows users to search and stream as if logged in on their computer, building and editing playlists must still be done on a computer. You must have iTunes version 9 to use this app. You can download the iPhone app by visiting <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nml/id338059159?mt=8" target="_blank">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nml/id338059159?mt=8</a>. 

For now, playlists may only be created online, rather than on one's phone. Naxos may change this in later editions of the iPhone app.

 Northeastern playlists will be created in the near future, which all Naxos users of the NU community will be able to view.

  Naxos can be found on the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/for_alumni/online_research/" target="_blank">Alumni Resources</a> page.
