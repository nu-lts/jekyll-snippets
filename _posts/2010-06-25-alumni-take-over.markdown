Do you miss your alma mater yet, alums? If you do, we've got a treat for you. Beginning June 25th, the first floor of [Snell Library ](http://www.lib.neu.edu)will undergo construction to create an Alumni Reading Room. This room has been made possible by a generous gift from [Dr. and Mrs. Eugene M. Reppucci, Jr](http://www.homecoming2006.neu.edu/awards/reppucci.html)., in honor of Dr. Reppucci’s late mother, Anna Reppucci. The room will open this fall. It will be situated to the right of the Library main entrance, facing [Snell Engineering.](http://www.coe.neu.edu/coe/undergraduate/studentservices/)

The primary purpose of the room is to provide a welcoming space for Northeastern alumni to relax, read, use their laptops, conduct research, and meet while on campus. Graduate students who have received their baccalaureates from Northeastern are also welcome to use the space. Additionally, the Library is pleased to offer the room to current students who would like to schedule a Student Group meeting or event. Students can book the room through the [Office of Student Affairs](http://www.northeastern.edu/studentlife/).

Study tables and seating previously located in the Reading Room space are being redeployed to other areas of the Library. Lesley Milner, Associate Dean of user services commented; “We are delighted to offer alumni and student groups what promises to be a beautiful new space.”

It must be understood that this room is first and foremost, for alumni, and their activities take precedence over student activities. Student group meetings may be overridden by alumni events.

For more questions, please contact Maria Carpenter at m.carpenter@neu.edu.
Further updates can be added to this post in the form of comments.
