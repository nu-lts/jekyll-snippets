Beginning July 23rd, the first floor of Snell Library will undergo construction to create an Alumni Reading Room. This room has been made possible by a generous gift from Dr. and Mrs. Eugene M. Reppucci, Jr., in honor of Dr. Reppucci’s late mother, Anna Reppucci. The room will open this fall. It will be situated to the right of the Library main entrance, facing Snell Engineering.

The primary purpose of the room is to provide a welcoming space for Northeastern alumni to relax, read, use their laptops, conduct research, and meet while on campus. Graduate students who have received their baccalaureates from Northeastern are also welcome to use the space.  Additionally, the Library is pleased to offer the room to current students who would like to schedule a Student Group meeting or event. Students can book the room through the Office of Student Affairs.

Study tables and seating previously located in the Reading Room space are being redeployed to other areas of the Library. “We are delighted to offer alumni and student groups what promises to be a beautiful new space. At the same time, we continue to provide students the same amount of seating during the day and additional two floors of seating in the late and early hours, with the advent of all floor 24 hour access that begins July 5,” said Lesley Milner, Associate Dean, User Services.
