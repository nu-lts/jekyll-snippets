Have you heard about the confrontation between Nature Publishing Group and the University of California faculty and library? If not, or if you want more information, read on!

In short, The Nature Publishing Group (NPG) (which publishes _Nature_ along with many other journals) wanted to renegotiate its contract with the University of California system, with a price increase amounting to about 400% (or over one million dollars). [The University not only resisted such an increase, but some faculty there have organized a boycott of _Nature_ journals](http://libraries.ucsd.edu/collections/Nature_Faculty_Letter-June_2010.pdf) (PDF): no submitting papers, no peer review, no editorial boards, and so on. In other words, withholding their mostly-free labor in the face of this price increase. Since then, [NPG has responded](http://www.nature.com/press_releases/cdl.html) and [UC/California Digital Library has responded to that response](http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/UC_Response_to_Nature_Publishing_Group.pdf) (PDF).

This is a topic that touches on a lot of different aspects of scholarly communication -- faculty as authors, the peer review process, journal prices... I welcome discussion, and will post updates as they come.
