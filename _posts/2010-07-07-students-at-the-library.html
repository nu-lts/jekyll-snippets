This post is not about students who use the library. We all know that tons of students find us useful. This post is about students who work here; some have for many semesters, others have begun only recently. Most are work study students, several are co-ops. Below are their profiles, with pictures.

If there is anybody I missed who wishes to be profiled, please let me know. I'm sure there are. (Unfortunately for my ego, I can't profile myself. No longer a student.)
