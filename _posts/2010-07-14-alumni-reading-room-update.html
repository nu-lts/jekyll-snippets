Let it be known that the construction on the <a href="index.php?p=1836">Alumni Reading room</a>, having been pushed back  from June 25th, is now set to begin on July 23rd. I will be posting signs and a revised version of the press release around the area where it will be tomorrow and Friday. The previous alumni reading room post has been updated with this new date also, just for the sake of consistency.

The room is still expected to open early in the fall semseter.
