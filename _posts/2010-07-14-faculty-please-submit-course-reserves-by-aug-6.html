<strong>August 6.  That's the deadline </strong>to guarantee that your assignments will be available on Reserve to your students for the fall term.

It's easy!  Faculty and TA's, just click on the library tab in<a href="http://myneu.neu.edu" target="_blank"> myNEU</a> to place your Course Reserves with the library.

What are Course Reserves?  Materials that faculty members ask the library to set aside for class reading.  It's not just for reading, however!  Faculty also may set aside DVDs, CDs, and VHS for class viewing and listening.

If you're a faculty member using Blackboard, you may wish to make the course readings in your syllabus into a hotlink in addition to putting photocopies on reserve.  There's no deadline for that!  The hotlink approach works best when:

1. The reading assignment is a journal article.

2. The library subscribes to the journal online (use our <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/ejournals" target="_blank">ejournal finder</a> to check)

Our web site has <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/help/create_url_blackboard/" target="_blank">more information about blackboard linking</a> and <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/course_reserves" target="_blank">Course Reserves</a>.
