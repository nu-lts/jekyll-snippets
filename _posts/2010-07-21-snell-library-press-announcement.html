Please see this recent news item from the <a href="http://huntnewsnu.com/" target="_blank">Huntington News </a>on our 24/7 service. Thanks to Jenna Duncan for getting this put up.
Also see this editorial (which I was informed of by way of a <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=1828#comments" target="_blank">comment</a>) on the Northeastern Facilities Department, which praises the 24/7 service, if cautiously.

I'm glad to see that we're getting press, even over the summer.
