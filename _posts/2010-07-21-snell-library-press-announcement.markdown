Please see this recent news item from the [Huntington News ](http://huntnewsnu.com/)on our 24/7 service. Thanks to Jenna Duncan for getting this put up.
Also see this editorial (which I was informed of by way of a [comment](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=1828#comments)) on the Northeastern Facilities Department, which praises the 24/7 service, if cautiously.

I'm glad to see that we're getting press, even over the summer.
