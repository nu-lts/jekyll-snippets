This post is to publicly thank [Joan Wickersham](http://www.joanwickersham.com/Site/welcome.html) for her lovely op-ed in today's [Globe](http://www.boston.com): "[A library tells a story of its own](http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2010/07/23/a_library_tells_a_story_of_its_own/)."

Speaking of the Malden Public Library, Wickersham writes:


> The library would tell you a lot about what America was like and how it has changed. It would speak about the history of architecture and art, of industrialism and philanthropy, of immigration, of economics, of literature and technology. And it would tell you about the hard choices that go into running a popular public institution in changing times.



As a librarian, I always find it gratifying to see members of the community speak out in praise of their local library! Happy reading for a Friday afternoon.
