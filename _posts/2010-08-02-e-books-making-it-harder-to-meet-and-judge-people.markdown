I just read an interesting piece in the online magazine _[Slate](http://www.slate.com)_ in which the author is lamenting the rise of e-books for a very specific reason: he thinks it will make it harder to meet people and form impressions of them or get to know them because we can't see what they're reading.

Check out the [article](http://www.slate.com/id/2261955/). The author, Mark Oppenheimer, notes that he enjoys looking around on the subway to see what books people are reading, and that he has learned more about people he was dating by observing the books on their shelves. If everyone on the train is carrying a [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Reading-Display-Graphite-Globally/dp/B002FQJT3Q) or a [Nook](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/index.asp), and books on apartment shelves vanish in favor of an [iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/) on the coffee table, he fears, we'll lose out on one of the best conversation-starters around.

What do you think? Is this an unforeseen drawback to the e-book revolution? Or is Oppenheimer worrying too much?
