On Sunday, a few friends and I decided that the <a href="http://christianscience.com/church/the-mother-church/boston-activities/" target="_blank">Christian Science Center</a> was worth investigating after 2+ years of walking curiously in its shadow. Inside, we found <a href="http://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/exhibits/mapparium" target="_blank">this</a> (above).

This enormous glowing globe - house is called the <em>Mapparium</em>. Its a three story painted glass globe that you walk inside. It's inside the <a href="http://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/" target="_blank">Mary Baker Eddy Library </a>on Mass. Avenue, and it's preeeetttty awesome. There is a fee to enter the Mapparium, which is bogus, but hey, its a measly four dollars for a unique, thought-provoking experience -- more than you'd get out of a Big Mac (also four dollars) from the McDonald's next door.

You enter on a bridge suspended in the earth's core (super cool). Then a brief light show begins (super cool) during which you examine the foreign cartography of this three-dimensional map made in 1935 (super cool). Like, what is French Indo-China? Oh, and this happens to be super cool: the acoustics of the perfect sphere are quite unique. From the center, your voice is very loud. I happened to be standing in the center. I've never felt so powerful, or so entertained. Not to mention somewhat rude. From the edge of the bridge, your voice can be heard very clearly by the person on the other side of the bridge, but not by others in the center, so two can have a secret conversation in plain globe-light. Everything about this place is... well, I think you know how I feel about it.

I vote we get one of these at Snell instead of an <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=1836" target="_blank">Alumni Reading Room</a>. No offense, Mom (class of '82).
