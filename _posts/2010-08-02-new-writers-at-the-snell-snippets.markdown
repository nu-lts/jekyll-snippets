With the school year coming around and new students pouring in, not to mention some new Library employees who have started working or will soon begin working at Snell, I want to send out a call for all potential bloggers. At Snell Snippets, we are trying to branch out, both in our service to the library and in the way we encompass all sections of the library. This means we are promoting news, resources, and general updates at a good rate, but we are also looking to include more people as contributing writers.
A contributing writer would be required to complete at least one post per week and they would be required to be trained as a blogger. All blog posts are intrinsically related to the library; either they are about a recent library development, or a book, film, CD, etc., that we have at Snell. Posts may also be about the broad topic of libraries, literature and literacy as it relates to our own goals.
As one of the primary blog goals is to get more students reading it, we are therefore trying to get more students to write for it. As of now, the blog administrators are mainly divided between the 2nd and third floor; Karen, Rebecca and myself. The same can be said of all contributors. Having several students working at Circulation to blog about the library from their perspective would be just one of many welcome additions. Of course, this is only an example.
I look forward to hearing from interested writers. Anybody with a skill for writing, reading and intellectual curiosity may apply. I know that includes a good many people here.
