A new influx of books on sustainability, climate change, and all things green have hit the [Library Stacks](http://www.lib.neu.edu/) in 2010. In following its commitment to sustainable development, [Northeastern](http://www.northeastern.edu) has been obtaining more relevant sources on the topic for its students. Some new titles that are available and have yet to even be checked out are...

[A Global Green New Deal](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/record=b2315834~S13) by Edward B. Barbier.



	
  * This book focuses on the need for global shifts in policy that will be able to meet short-term and long-term sustainability needs without creating economic or environmental crises in the future.


[Co-Opportunity](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/record=b2296409~S13) by John Grant.



	
  * This book follows the same theme of cooperation on a larger scale to achieve environmental change. It focuses on the relationship of the economy and the environment, the government's current role and ideal role, and how individuals, communities, and countries can work cooperatively to achieve goals with relative ease and low expenses.


[Mainstreaming Climate Change In Developmental Cooperation](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/record=b2315605~S13)



	
  * This book gives a theoretical, political, and practical perspective on the role of developmental cooperation needed between developed and developing countries. The focus on climate change and aid theory make us rethink the need to help developing countries as a step to achieving global environmental progress.


The theme of environmental cooperation is obvious in these three examples and it fits perfectly with Northeastern's commitment to the community and to cooperative education.
