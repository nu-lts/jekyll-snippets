Did you know that you can <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/ask_a_librarian/text_message/" target="_blank">Text a Librarian</a> for answers to all of your library or literature questions? All you have to do is text your question to <strong>66746</strong> and begin your message with the word <strong>husky</strong>.

You can also get answers at the Reference DeskÂ  by calling (617) 373-2356, or visiting on the second floor of <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/">Snell Library</a> during these hours:
<table style="height: 81px;" width="300">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Mon-Thurs:</td>
<td>9:00am - 9:00pm</td>
</tr>
<tr>

Coming to a Snell Librarian with your questions guarantees that you'll get put in the right direction, and they often go above and beyond the scope of their job to assist you in whatever project you have.
