If you haven't checked out our new book lists--or subscribed to the rss feed--we publish new lists of new titles every week.  Yes the economy's bad, but we are still buying new books, journals, CDs and films, and online resources.

Here's a sample of what's new in the library this week:

Since we're in the season of meteor showers, it might be interesting to look at <em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2302542~S14" target="_blank">The Fallen Sky: An Intimate History of Shooting Stars</a></em> by Christopher Cokinos, a study of the pioneering explorers and eccentrics who've become entranced by the meteors and their imprints on earth.

Natalie Merchant's <em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2299456~S14" target="_blank">Leave Your Sleep</a></em>, from our CD collection, is a set of folk songs and nursery-rhyme inspired songs focusing on themes of motherhood and childhood.  Rolling Stone says, "The music is beautiful and the vibe mellow," and you can hear her talk about it in a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125857459" target="_blank">radio interview and sample the music here</a>.

A number of new titles about alternative energy, including its use in <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2299619~S14" target="_blank">building design</a>, the pioneering promise of <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2300889~S14" target="_blank">nanotechnology in photovoltaics</a>, a history of <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2302545~S14" target="_blank">hybrid cars</a>, and a look at <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2301167~S14" target="_blank">wind energy</a> are also new this week in the library.

Finally, there's my favorite genre: biography.  A <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2298618~S14" target="_blank">biography of Mum Bett</a>, the first slave granted her freedom by a United States court, in Massachusetts in 1781, by arguing that "all men are born free and equal" made her slavery illegal in Massachusetts.  A group biography of presidents <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2299179~S14" target="_blank">Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson</a> also makes its appearance.
