If you haven't checked out our new book lists--or subscribed to the rss feed--we publish new lists of new titles every week.  Yes the economy's bad, but we are still buying new books, journals, CDs and films, and online resources.

Here's a sample of what's new in the library this week:

Since we're in the season of meteor showers, it might be interesting to look at _[The Fallen Sky: An Intimate History of Shooting Stars](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2302542~S14)_ by Christopher Cokinos, a study of the pioneering explorers and eccentrics who've become entranced by the meteors and their imprints on earth.

Natalie Merchant's _[Leave Your Sleep](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2299456~S14)_, from our CD collection, is a set of folk songs and nursery-rhyme inspired songs focusing on themes of motherhood and childhood.  Rolling Stone says, "The music is beautiful and the vibe mellow," and you can hear her talk about it in a [radio interview and sample the music here](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125857459).

A number of new titles about alternative energy, including its use in [building design](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2299619~S14), the pioneering promise of [nanotechnology in photovoltaics](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2300889~S14), a history of [hybrid cars](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2302545~S14), and a look at [wind energy](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2301167~S14) are also new this week in the library.

Finally, there's my favorite genre: biography.  A [biography of Mum Bett](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2298618~S14), the first slave granted her freedom by a United States court, in Massachusetts in 1781, by arguing that "all men are born free and equal" made her slavery illegal in Massachusetts.  A group biography of presidents [Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2299179~S14) also makes its appearance.
