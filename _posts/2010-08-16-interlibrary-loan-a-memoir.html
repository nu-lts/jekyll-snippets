So my favorite easy read author is <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/" target="_blank">Harlan Coben</a>. He comes out with a few books every year and they’re fast paced mysteries that I find extremely easy to breeze through in just a few days. Given that he only comes out with one or two a year in hard cover it’s difficult to read them all right away. This is why I would like to give a big thanks to Northeastern Universities Inter-Library Loan. When I first decided to check if he had released a new book, <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/" target="_blank">NUcat</a> helped me out and found that the only copy of his new novel was at the <a href="http://web.wellesley.edu/web/Dept/LT" target="_blank">Wellesley College Library</a>. Under the advice of the librarian assisting me, I put a request through ILL in about 30 seconds and the book left my mind. Two days later as I’m leaving for the weekend and looking for a read on the bus, I get <em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b1506758~S13" target="_blank">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></em>. I figured I’d give it a second go since it's been a few years, and the guy working the desk says my book is in! Two days. Literally it arrived before I even remembered ordering it. And to top it off, the book is great! I just started it a day ago and I’m already 200 pages in. Thanks Inter-Library Loan!! I will definitely be using this service again!
