So my favorite easy read author is [Harlan Coben](http://www.harlancoben.com/). He comes out with a few books every year and they’re fast paced mysteries that I find extremely easy to breeze through in just a few days. Given that he only comes out with one or two a year in hard cover it’s difficult to read them all right away. This is why I would like to give a big thanks to Northeastern Universities Inter-Library Loan. When I first decided to check if he had released a new book, [NUcat](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/) helped me out and found that the only copy of his new novel was at the [Wellesley College Library](http://web.wellesley.edu/web/Dept/LT). Under the advice of the librarian assisting me, I put a request through ILL in about 30 seconds and the book left my mind. Two days later as I’m leaving for the weekend and looking for a read on the bus, I get _[To Kill a Mockingbird](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b1506758~S13)_. I figured I’d give it a second go since it's been a few years, and the guy working the desk says my book is in! Two days. Literally it arrived before I even remembered ordering it. And to top it off, the book is great! I just started it a day ago and I’m already 200 pages in. Thanks Inter-Library Loan!! I will definitely be using this service again!
