If you've been looking for Business Source Premier, we have upgraded it and its name has changed!

<a href="http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?authtype=ip,uid&amp;profile=bsi&amp;defaultdb=bth">Business Source Complete</a> is the upgraded version of Business Source Premier, and it includes more full-text peer-reviewed journals, more trade journals, more industry and company profiles, more market research reports and more working papers.Â  Business Source Complete also includes some types of resources not available in Business Source Premier, such as author profiles, full-text interviews (executive &amp; analyst) and faculty seminars (videos).

Enjoy the upgrade !
