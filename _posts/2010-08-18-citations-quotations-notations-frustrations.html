Remember when before <a href="http://www.easybib.com" target="_blank">EasyBib</a> you actually had to know what citation convention you were using and actually format your citation yourself? If you're like me, of course you don't, because we grew up in the computer age.

Regardless, citations are a crucial function to the scholarly process, and withholding due credit (not citing your sources) or even citing incorrectly is frowned upon to the extent of expulsion for plagiarism. Some of the new features on EasyBib have made this process even easier by automatically citing sources based on article titles, and giving a much wider range of citation formats and documentation options. Unfortunately, you still have to cite within your actual text manually, a process that is known to be arduous and often time consuming...until now (for those of you who didn't know about this before reading my blog post).

Available through on the Self-Service tab of <a href="http://www.myneu.neu.edu" target="_blank">MyNEU</a>, by clicking into Software Downloads you will find the answer to all things citation related. The program named <a href="http://www.endnote.com/eninfo.asp">EndNote</a>, aptly puts an End to all of your Note-ation problems (I try to be funny... it usually never works). Straight from EndNote themselves...
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">"Millions of researchers, scholarly writers, students and librarians use EndNote to search online bibliographic databases, organize their references, images and</span><span style="font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial; font-size: x-small;"> PDFs in any language</span><span style="font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">, and create bibliographies and figure lists instantly. Instead of spending hours typing bibliographies, or using index cards to organize their references, they do it the easy wayâ€”by using EndNote" </span></em><span style="font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial; color: #000000;">(Endnote).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial; color: #000000;">See the citation convention I used there? All thanks to <a href="http://http://www.endnote.com/">EndNote</a>! Some other cool functions include automatic paper formatting, template extensions, online reference searches, customizable export options, and more. So, while <a href="http://www.easybib.com">EasyBib</a> may be a great tool for citations, the software provided by <a href="http://www.neu.edu">Northeastern</a> will make sure you aren't stuck in <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/">Snell Library</a> all night.
