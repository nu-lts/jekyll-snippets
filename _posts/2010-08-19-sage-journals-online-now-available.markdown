We're excited to announce that we've expanded our collection of Sage publications online to over 560 journals. Coverage includes journals in the social sciences, health, business, and related disciplines.

You can access these through the database [Sage Journals Online](http://0-online.sagepub.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/), where you can choose a specific journal title or search by keyword or topic.

You can also find an individual Sage journal title through [NUCat](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu) or the [E-journal Finder](http://www.lib.neu.edu/ejournals/).
