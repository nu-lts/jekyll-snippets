The Libraries have a great new resource available for students and faculty: the **[Henry Stewart Talks, also called The Biomedical & Life Sciences Collection](http://0-hstalks.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/main/index_category.php?id=252)**. Here's a way to browse and view or listen to lectures by experts in the sciences, including Nobel Laureates.

There are over one thousand seminar talks to choose from, on topics ranging from [**Antibiotic Resistance** ](http://0-hstalks.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/main/browse_talks.php?father_id=442&c=252)and [**The Blood-Brain Barrier** ](http://0-hstalks.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/main/browse_talks.php?father_id=277&c=252)to **[**Health Economics** ](http://0-hstalks.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/main/browse_talks.php?father_id=409&c=252)**and [**Using Bioinformatics in the Exploration of Genetic Diversity**.](http://0-hstalks.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/main/browse_talks.php?father_id=40&c=252)

Some are overviews, while others cover recent developments. Note the wide range of lectures on [**Cognitive Neuroscience**](http://0-hstalks.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/main/browse_talks.php?father_id=445&c=252).

While the focus is on biomedicine, the seminars also are useful for those who focus on the social and administrative science aspects of medicine and life sciences.

When this was a trial resource, we received many enthusiastic comments from the NU community, which helped to make this purchase possible. Remember that your comments on [trial resources](../../online_research/articles/database_trials1/) are always valuable to the staff and are considered when we make our collection decisions.
