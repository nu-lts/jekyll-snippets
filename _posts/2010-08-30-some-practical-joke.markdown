Recently, we've been seeing signs posted around the library, possibly on every floor, that read:

Club Snell Announces: 24/7 PARTY. Starting July 5th, 2010. All floors will be open as dance space to Students, Faculty and Staff with current Husky ID. Sorry, no BU students.

Okay so...we can take the high road and admit that this is kind of funny. The signs are versions of the template that Krissy created in June to announce the 24/7 library service. It is not clear how somebody got a hold of the template for this sign and was able to print it. Judging from the fact that it's in black and white, though, it must have been printed in the info commons.

Still, if you see one of these signs, you can take it down and junk it. More detective work to follow, perhaps.
