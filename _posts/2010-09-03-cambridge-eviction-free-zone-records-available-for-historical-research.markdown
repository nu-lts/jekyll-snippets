We are pleased to announce that the historical records of the Cambridge Eviction Free Zone are now available in the [NU Archives](http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives), located on the lower level of the Snell Library.

This collection is part of the local history collections in the NU Libraries Archives and Special Collections. Many people do not realize that, in addition to collecting historical records of Northeastern, we also collect local history records and documents, focusing especially on Boston-area social justice organizations that serve under-represented communities.

Founded in 1988, the Cambridge Eviction Free Zone (EFZ) was an independent, tenant-run community organization that worked for social and economic justice in the areas of housing and tenants' rights, rent control, and immigrant voting rights.

The collection includes meeting minutes, reports, newsletters, newspaper clippings, promotional materials such as flyers, photographs, signs, and memorabilia.
