Lately the news has been a little slow!  Everyone was either on vacation or trying to save the cat from Hurricane Earl.  A few biology and health sciences articles that did break can be read through the NU Libraries:

1. SAMe, a natural chemical often used as a dietary supplement, [may alleviate depression](http://0-ajp.psychiatryonline.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/cgi/content/abstract/ajp;167/8/942).

2. In the latest issue of Nature, E.O. Wilson and two colleagues used mathematics to [prove that even self-sacrificing altruistic behavior in animals like ants can be explained with the theory of natural selection](http://0-www.nature.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/nature/journal/v466/n7310/full/nature09205.html).  For decades it has been thought that altruistic behavior was not consistent with natural selection and other theories like "kin selection" (protecting the survival of the family) were needed to explain it.

3. In sports news, an article in the [New Journal of Physics explains the ideal spiral](http://0-iopscience.iop.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/1367-2630/12/9/093004) kicked by Brazilian soccer player Roberto Carlos against France in 1997.  ([Watch it on YouTube here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSkWaJqx-Y).)

4. This week, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court sided with a psychotherapist, upholding patient confidentiality against Massachusetts Board of Registration, which tried to subpoena medical records from him.  The complete decision is [available in Lexis-Nexis](http://0-www.lexisnexis.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&csi=6496&sr=CITE(2010+Mass.+LEXIS+603)).

5. It might be a meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs, but [no comet or other impact 12,500 years ago](http://0-www.sciencemag.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/cgi/content/full/329/5996/1140) killed the mammoths and other beasts, according to the latest issue of Science.

And yes, we're working on that [new book by Stephen Hawking](http://www.amazon.com/Grand-Design-Stephen-Hawking/dp/0553805371/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1284046220&sr=8-1)...I'll let you know when it arrives!
