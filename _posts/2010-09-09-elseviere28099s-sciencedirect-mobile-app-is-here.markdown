Want to access full-text scientific articles from one of the world's largest scientific, technical, and medical information providers, but not near a computer?  You can now access Elsevier ScienceDirect content on your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad with a [new free app available in iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sciencedirect-lite-institutional/id383622545?mt=8).

The only thing you need to get started is to [register](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/newregistration) on ScienceDirect.com.  You will have to do this while on campus, but after that you will be able to use the application anywhere. As part of the registration process you will need to create a username and password (different from your Northeastern username and password) and provide Elsevier with your Northeastern email address.  Your Northeastern email address is used to verify that you are a member of the Northeastern community.

Try it out and let us know what you think, either [here](http://www.lib.neu.edu/contact_us/) or in the comments!
