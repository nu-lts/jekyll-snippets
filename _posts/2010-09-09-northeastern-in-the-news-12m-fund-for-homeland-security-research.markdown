Northeastern was recently mentioned in the [Boston Globe](http://www.boston.com), in a story that reports a donation of $12 million dollars given to the school to build a homeland security research facility on the Burlington, MA campus.

The donor is former engineering student George Kostas, who  graduated in 1943. The resulting facility could potentially change Northeastern's status amongst other universities in terms of defense and military research. This is a field the university has been advancing in for the past two years.

Now, if we could just get a donation such as this for the library...we could hire a plethora of people and cancel all Sales Force meetings for the next few years.
