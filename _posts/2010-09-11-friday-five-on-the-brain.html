Today's Friday Five starts with the mind.  Specifically,<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/views/07mind.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=homepage&amp;src=me" target="_blank"> the hottest article in this week's Times</a>, judging by the number of times emailed, debunked common myths about studying.

Based on a <a href="http://0-psi.sagepub.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/content/9/3/105.full" target="_blank">review article in Psychological Science</a>, it says there are no "left-brain" and "right-brain" learning styles, we all basically learn the same way!    Furthermore, you should study a mix of different things and not immerse yourself in one thing according to a <a href="http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=pdh&amp;AN=pag-25-2-498&amp;site=ehost-live" target="_blank">study of college students and retired people in the Journal of Psychology and Aging</a>.  Other studies say you should study in different rooms not just sit in one place because changes of scene and environment help you to remember.  Finally, <a href="http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=pdh&amp;AN=xlm-33-4-704&amp;site=ehost-live" target="_blank">spacing your studying, and testing,</a> help you remember better over the long term.

Ready to blame the teacher?  Turns out that's hard, we don't really know scientifically what makes a teacher successful at getting kids to learn, according to Daniel T. Willingham, a psychologist at the University of Virginia and author of the book “<a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2223640~S13" target="_blank">Why Don’t Students Like School</a>?” (available on the 3rd floor of Snell Library!)

Finally, <a href="http://0-www.sciencemag.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/cgi/content/abstract/sci;329/5997/1358?maxtoshow=&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=Dosenbach&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT" target="_blank">an MRI scan can map brain development in children</a>, according to research in the journal <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org" target="_blank">Science</a>.  It could allow doctors to place children on a "maturation curve" just like we do with height and weight and perhaps even be alerted to signs of disorders.
