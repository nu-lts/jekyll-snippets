Today's Friday Five starts with the mind.  Specifically,[ the hottest article in this week's Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/views/07mind.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=homepage&src=me), judging by the number of times emailed, debunked common myths about studying.

Based on a [review article in Psychological Science](http://0-psi.sagepub.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/content/9/3/105.full), it says there are no "left-brain" and "right-brain" learning styles, we all basically learn the same way!    Furthermore, you should study a mix of different things and not immerse yourself in one thing according to a [study of college students and retired people in the Journal of Psychology and Aging](http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pdh&AN=pag-25-2-498&site=ehost-live).  Other studies say you should study in different rooms not just sit in one place because changes of scene and environment help you to remember.  Finally, [spacing your studying, and testing,](http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pdh&AN=xlm-33-4-704&site=ehost-live) help you remember better over the long term.

Ready to blame the teacher?  Turns out that's hard, we don't really know scientifically what makes a teacher successful at getting kids to learn, according to Daniel T. Willingham, a psychologist at the University of Virginia and author of the book “[Why Don’t Students Like School](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2223640~S13)?” (available on the 3rd floor of Snell Library!)

Finally, [an MRI scan can map brain development in children](http://0-www.sciencemag.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/cgi/content/abstract/sci;329/5997/1358?maxtoshow=&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=Dosenbach&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT), according to research in the journal [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org).  It could allow doctors to place children on a "maturation curve" just like we do with height and weight and perhaps even be alerted to signs of disorders.
