The Meet the Author Series will kick off this Tuesday, September 14th, with John J. Siegfried. He will be speaking on <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Better-Living-through-Economics-Siegfried/dp/0674036182/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1284399292&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Better Living through Economics</a></em>, which he edited. <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2280349~S13" target="_blank">The book</a> is a study of how economic reforms over the past fifty years have helped to raise the standard of living in America and to make the country prosperous. The event will be co-sponsored by the Department of Economics and the NU Bookstore.

The following day, Wednesday, September 15, will feature our second event, with another John, the journalist John Hollway. He will be discussing his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Killing-Time-18-Year-Odyssey-Freedom/dp/1602399743/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1284399320&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Killing Time</a></em>, which he co-authored with Ronald M. Gauthier. <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/tkilling+time/tkilling+time/1%2C10%2C12%2CE/2exact&amp;FF=tkilling+time+an+++18+year+odyssey+from+death+row+to+freedom&amp;1%2C2%2C/indexsort=-" target="_blank">The book</a> describes the Death Row sentence of John Thompson, a black man convicted of killing a rich white man in New Orleans. Thompson insists he is innocent, and eventually two Philadelphia lawyers step in to the case, ultimately proving his innocence. This event is co-sponsored by the NU School of Law, the NU Bookstore, and NU Phi Alpha Delta.

Both <em>Better Living through Economics</em> and <em>Killing Time</em> will take place in 90 Snell Library at noon.

The third John featured this week will be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane" target="_blank">John Coltrane</a>, whose annual memorial concert takes place this Saturday. Before the concert, on Thursday the 16th from 6:00-8:00 pm in the Amilcar Cabral Center of the NU African American Institute, the Library is co-sponsoring a symposium and book-signing for the recent release of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coltrane-Black-Americas-Quest-Freedom/dp/0195328922/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1284400796&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank">John Coltrane and Black America's Quest for Freedom: Spirituality and the Music</a></em>. Unfortunately, John Coltrane himself, who has been dead for some forty-three years, will not be making it to these events. Yet this is a great opportunity to hear a panel of Coltrane experts moderated by NU music professor and jazz composer Leonard Brown, who organized the concert and edited the book.

The talks are free and open to the public and refreshments will be served. For further questions about any of these events, please contact Maria Carpenter at m.carpenter@neu.edu. For campus directions, click <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/campusmap/" target="_blank">here</a>.
