So it's Fall 2010; some of us are back from Co-op, some of us fresh off a great summer... The unfortunate ones like me are in class again after having summer classes. The one thing that joins us all together: **WE NEED MONEY!**

I remember hearing before summer started that unemployment figures for the 16-20 age group reached worse-than-Great Depression levels. What that meant was less summer jobs, less party money, and just less fun for all of us students. One of the easiest ways to combat the recession, stay employed, and keep money coming in is to **update your resume.**

Before college, I thought you just have one simple resume that you use for everything and update as you go through life. If those of you reading this are like, well I still think that... you are _WRONG._ The reality is that your resume should be specifically tailored toward the job you're applying for, with certain previous experiences and skills highlighted or left out accordingly. It can take a lot of effort and a lot of guesswork to really shine through to employers, but it is the most crucial step to getting an interview or a job.

Luckily, Northeastern knows that jobs during and after college are just as important as the education you receive. Hence the co-op program, and hence **[Career Services](http://careerservices.neu.edu/home.php) walk-in hours**! Check out the Walk In Hours from 2pm-4pm Monday through Thursday in **202 Stearns Hall**. Someone will be there to give you a **10-15 minute **session reviewing your resume.

Check out other great resume resources at the [Career Services page](http://careerservices.neu.edu/resumes.php). And of course, don't forget the resume help you can get from [books in Snell Library](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search/X?SEARCH=resumes&searchscope=13&submit=Search)!
