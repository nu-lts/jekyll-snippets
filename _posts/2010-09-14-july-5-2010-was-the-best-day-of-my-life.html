This was by far the best quote I heard during Welcome Week by an exuberant student walking into Snell Library. She saw the Library's Welcome Week table that featured an announcement about 24 hour study in the Library, which we began offering on July 5. As staff volunteers, my colleagues and I were able to welcome students and visitors to their Library. It was a lot of fun and students asked so many sensible questions about the Library and getting around campus. Even President Aoun stopped by a couple of times.

I would like to say to the student I quoted, "You've got it sister, and we have your back." The Library is YOUR library and we are here to provide research assistance and to stimulate learning and exploration. 24 hours started because the student body spoke up. We want you to succeed in your academic pursuit and we have an abundance of resources, tools and experts to help you along!

In addition to being open to students, faculty and staff all hours around the clock, we have text-a-librarian, consult with a librarian, and faculty can request an instruction session led by a librarian for your class. Â We also have many new resources such as American Periodicals Series and mobile apps for research databases.

Wishing you the best at the start of the fall term!
