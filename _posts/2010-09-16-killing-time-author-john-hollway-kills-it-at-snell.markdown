To begin, let me say that if you missed this author talk with John Hollway, you missed something pretty special. The passion coming from both John and his audience was intense and a lot of important issues were covered. For those of you who were unable to make it but want to experience the presentation, try checking out the [Library's Meet The Author YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=693D78176FF28E0C), where all previous Meet The Author presentations are uploaded for you to enjoy. This talk will be added shortly.




John's telling of a true story about a man being unjustly sent to death row and then released 18 years later evoked many questions, one especially important one being, "If it happened to him, how many others are there?" Not only that but how many we don't know about. When I thought about this, I kind of had a flash and thought of the film [_Law Abiding Citizen_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1197624/) and how the justice system doesn't actually provide justice under many circumstances. After hearing everything about the story, I wouldn't doubt a movie on this book will come out in the very near future with a lot of the same themes, maybe less time killing people though.




The civil case for negligence damages for this particular victim of the justice system is heading to the Supreme Court later this fall, so keep an eye on the Facebook page, "[Killing Time by John Hollway and Ronald M. Gauthier](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Killing-Time-by-John-Hollway-and-Ronald-M-Gauthier/253711767734#!/pages/Killing-Time-by-John-Hollway-and-Ronald-M-Gauthier/253711767734?ref=search)" for more info. Be sure not to miss out on future Meet The Author events by checking back on the blog or going to the [Library's News & Events](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/) page.
