YOUR PRAYERS SHALL BEÂ ANSWERED!!! No more waiting 5-20 minutes because printing in the InfoCommons is backlogged. No more waiting on a huge Instant Print line for 1 page. No more unnecessary cover sheets that waste paper. WIRELESS PRINTING!

More specs to come, but get pumped for this. Printing will never be the same again. Coming soon to a library near you!
