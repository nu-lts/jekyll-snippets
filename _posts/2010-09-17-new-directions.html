      We have a number of new students blogging for Snell Snippets now; among them are Rachel Holt, Michelle Beiter and Joe Bober, all recent hires in the Advancement office. Brendan Ratner, also work study, will continue to blog, and who knows who else will come on board. As long as everybody makes sure to keep us updated on Library news and events, in particular the Meet the Author Series, we should be good.
         I am glad to be introducing these new contributors and sad to say that this day (Friday, the 17th) is my last day and that this will be my last post on this blog. All questions about the blog should from now on be directed to Karen Merguerian (g.merguerian@neu.edu) or Maria Carpenter (m.carpenter@neu.edu). Thanks everybody who has contributed throughout my time here, and keep posting.
