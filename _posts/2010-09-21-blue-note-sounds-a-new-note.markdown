The [Jazz Music Library](http://0-jazz.alexanderstreet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/) from Alexander Street Press now includes recordings from Blue Note records, the recording label known for high-quality albums from the beginning of the jazz age through the 1960s and beyond.

With these new online recordings now available to the NU community, you can listen to Herbie Hancock, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Dexter Gorden, Art Blakey and more!  These are for the most part digital remasters, so for the true aficionados out there, you may need to come to the library and seek out the [Solomon Jazz collection](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13/?searchtype=X&searcharg=solomon+jazz+collection&searchscope=13&sortdropdown=-&SORT=DZ&extended=1&SUBMIT=Search&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=Xsolomon+jazz%26SORT%3DD) on vinyl, but for your classes or for listening pleasure, these are convenient gems of a true American classical art form.  Enjoy!
