NU Libraries subscribes to wonderful online music services, easily accessed from our [Video and Sound page](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/video_and_sound/).

Here are some "hot off the press" destinations for your wandering mind:

**Jazz Music Library Update:**
Alexander Street Press just added 850 Blue Note label recordings to their Jazz Music Library. Blue Note, founded in 1939 and sold to EMI in 2006, includes diverse styles associated with "hard bop" jazz.

To access these recordings and musician biographies, go to the [Jazz Music Library](http://0-jazz.alexanderstreet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/). You can search by Blue Note.

The new content includes releases by Benny Goodman, Buddy Rich, Bobby McFerrin, Nancy Wilson, Cassandra Wilson, Wynton Marsalis, Louis Prima, Nigel Kennedy, Bernadette Peters, and more. Great recordings include:

* Duke Ellington Live at the Blue Note
* The Complete Imperial Sessions: Sonny Criss
* The Rudy van Gelder Edition CDs of Sonny Rollins, Herbie Hancock, Walter Davis Jr, Andrew Hill, Dexter Gordon, and more
* Benny Green Live at the Village Vanguard
* David Axelrod at Capitol Records (1966-1970)
* The Complete Capitol Recordings of Art Tatum
* The Complete Blue Note Recordings of Herbie Nichols
* Kenny Burrell 75th Birthday Bash Live

All of the new tracks run at both 192kbps and 320kbps bitrates.

**Smithsonian Global Sound Update: New Free Download!**
[Smithsonian Global Sound](http://0-glmu.alexanderstreet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/), another marvelous listening service, features music from around the world. As part of a new bi-weekly tradition, Alexander Street and Smithsonian Folkways Recordings offer a free music download.

September 15 to October 15 is National Hispanic Heritage Month. Join in the celebration with a free download of “Paraguarí” performed by harp master Marcelo Rojas from the 2009 Smithsonian Folkways album Maiteí América: Harps of Paraguay.
