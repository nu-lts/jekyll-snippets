Everyone in Boston seems to be buzzing about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0840361/" target="_blank"><em>The Town</em></a>, and while I haven't had the chance to see it yet, what with classes in full swing, I have to agree that it looks pretty fantastic. But, seeing as I'm a usual skeptic before watching movies longer than an hour and a half, I did a little research first. After seeing that Ben Affleck's previous foray into directing (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452623/" target="_blank"><em>Gone Baby Gone</em></a>, Oct 2007) was hailed by many critics and received a 7.5 out of 10 on <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gone-baby-gone" target="_blank">metacritic.com</a>, I decided to watch <a href="http://www.moviefone.com/movie/the-town/38942/trailers" target="_blank">the trailer for <em>The Town</em></a>, and really see what this thing is about.

For those who don't know yet, <em>The Town</em> is set in Charlestown and the North End, and seems to be a mix of the <em>Bourne</em> movies with less mystery, and more of an inlaid plot conflict, with Affleck's character falling in love with the hostage taken from a robbery, who has no idea of his true identity. The film has had a great opening weekend, grossing over 23 million dollars. (You can <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_town/" target="_blank">read reviews here</a>.)

<em>The Town</em> also stars Chris Cooper (<em>American Beauty</em>, <em>Capote</em>), whose wife, Marianne Leone, will be visiting Snell Library for a <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/" target="_blank">Meet the Author event</a> on November 3. She'll be discussing her book, <em>Knowing Jesse</em>, about the couple's son who passed away in 2005 due to complications from cerebral palsy.
