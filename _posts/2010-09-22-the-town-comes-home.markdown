Everyone in Boston seems to be buzzing about [_The Town_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0840361/), and while I haven't had the chance to see it yet, what with classes in full swing, I have to agree that it looks pretty fantastic. But, seeing as I'm a usual skeptic before watching movies longer than an hour and a half, I did a little research first. After seeing that Ben Affleck's previous foray into directing ([_Gone Baby Gone_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452623/), Oct 2007) was hailed by many critics and received a 7.5 out of 10 on [metacritic.com](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gone-baby-gone), I decided to watch [the trailer for _The Town_](http://www.moviefone.com/movie/the-town/38942/trailers), and really see what this thing is about.

For those who don't know yet, _The Town_ is set in Charlestown and the North End, and seems to be a mix of the _Bourne_ movies with less mystery, and more of an inlaid plot conflict, with Affleck's character falling in love with the hostage taken from a robbery, who has no idea of his true identity. The film has had a great opening weekend, grossing over 23 million dollars. (You can [read reviews here](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_town/).)

_The Town_ also stars Chris Cooper (_American Beauty_, _Capote_), whose wife, Marianne Leone, will be visiting Snell Library for a [Meet the Author event](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/) on November 3. She'll be discussing her book, _Knowing Jesse_, about the couple's son who passed away in 2005 due to complications from cerebral palsy.
