Please join me in welcoming Nina Shah, our newest addition to the Northeastern University Libraries' Advancement and Marketing team. Nina started on Monday, September 20th in her role as the Libraryâ€™s Advancement, Marketing, and Communications Assistant. She brings two years of professional marketing experience to Northeastern through her previous position as a Marketing Analyst for EnerNOC Inc., an energy management firm in downtown Boston.

Prior to EnerNOC, Nina received her business degree from Villanova University where she majored in Marketing and minored in International Business. She has a diverse background in marketing including event and tradeshow planning and execution, customer service and retention, budgeting and fundraising, corporate branding, and market research.

She loves to travel, experience new cultures, and eat delicious food. She also enjoys the outdoors, especially hiking, kayaking, camping, biking and swimming. Nina is looking forward to meeting other members of the Northeastern community and is enjoying diving into her new role!
