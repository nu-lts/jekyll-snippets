Ever wash your hands and have no paper towels left? Leaving you to shake them as fast as you can, rub them on your clothes, or hold them awkwardly away from your body while they air dry? Of course that never happens at <a href="http://www.neu.edu" target="_blank">Northeastern</a>, because of our great Facilities branch, but at <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/" target="_blank">Snell Library</a> it will never, ever happen.

In conjunction with sustainable initiatives around Northeastern, you will find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_dryer" target="_blank">warm-air dryers</a> slowly replacing paper towel dispensers in all Snell Library bathrooms. In addition to reducing litter and solid waste, the warm-air dryers require minimal maintenance (no refilling) which will help save time and money in Snell.

We'd love to hear your input, do you like warm-air dryers, or prefer plain old paper towels? Me personally, I like the warm-air dryers. The sustainability and savings aspect is all well and good but the real benefit of those is being able to do this:
