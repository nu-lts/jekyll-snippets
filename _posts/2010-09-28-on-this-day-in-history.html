On September 27th, 1998 a record was set that we would have never thought could be done, and one we never thought would be repeated. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_McGwire" target="_blank">Mark McGwire</a> of the <a href="http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=stl" target="_blank">St. Louis Cardinals</a> hit his record-setting 69th and 70th home runs in the last game of the season to beat out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Sosa" target="_blank">Sammy Sosa</a> in the Home Run race. At that time, the use of steroids wasn't even a consideration.

Years later, when the record was impossibly broken by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Bonds" target="_blank">Barry Bonds*</a>, there were countless questions, accusations, and investigations to his sudden power surge. This resulted in the largest exposure of a drug scandal to hit professional sports ever, and has spurred on completely new areas of study about sports, regulation, and the standards by owners that lead to drug abuse.

New to the University Libraries are some books written on the subject in the current year, past much of the controversy and accusations. These books are able to reflect and give a fresh perspective now that most athletes involved have been named and regulations imposed. The effect is far from over however, as we see stricter testing and more importance being put on the public image of individuals as well as entire teams and sports organizations.

Here are some sample titles in Snell Library's collections:
