Can you believe September is ending already?!
 
I know that classes are in full swing, which inevitably means late night study sessions in Snell, long papers and lab reports, and lots of coffee.  But if you're a Communications major like me and you have a lot of free time on your hands (JUST KIDDING) you might be looking for an interesting book to read.  Well, I can give you three, thanks to Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, which includes <a href="http://129.10.107.106:80/record=b2295864~S13" target="_blank"><em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em></a>, <em><a href="http://129.10.107.106:80/record=b2295450~S13" target="_blank">The Girl Who Played with Fire</a></em>, <em>and <a href="http://129.10.107.106:80/record=b2303743~S13" target="_blank">The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest</a></em>.  The primary characters are Lisbeth Salander, an intelligent computer hacker in her twenties, and Mikael Blomkvist, a middle-aged, womanizing investigative journalist.  Throughout the series we learn both characters have certain personality flaws, but regardless, you can’t help but root for them as they battle a slew of bad guys, including crooked businessmen, deplorable rapists, and freakish murderers.  This is a series that both males and females can enjoy---Lisbeth is a strong female character who resonates with women, but the strong plot led by Blomkvist is packed with enough action to keep the guys interested.  If you’re still not convinced, the trilogy has turned Larsson into a #1 International Best Seller (tragically he died before the books were published and never got to see the success of his work).  A Swedish film company has already <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132620/" target="_blank">turned</a> the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1216487/" target="_blank">books</a> into <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343097/" target="_blank">movies</a>, but if you’re not into subtitles, the first <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568346/" target="_blank">American adaptation</a> of the trilogy starring Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist is set to be released next year.  Personally, I can’t wait.

Although I have nothing but praise for Larsson’s work, I should probably issue a warning that <em><a href="http://129.10.107.106:80/record=b2295864~S13" target="_blank">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a></em> starts out slow. But once you are past the first one-hundred pages or so, you will be hooked.  So next time you get a study break, check into Snell and check out Larsson’s thrilling series.  Happy reading!
