<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">We're experiencing weird certificate errors today (Sunday).
</span>

This is a Monday night update.  We're on our way to a solution, and most of our systems should now be working.  NuCat logins for renewing, checking your account, and booking rooms should be fixed.

<strong>If you're using Firefox, </strong>and you get a message that the site has a "Peer Certificate" problem, try adjusting your settings:

Go to Firefox Options--Advanced--Encryption tab--Validation button.   Uncheck "Use the Online Certificate Status Protocol..."

<strong>If you're in IE,</strong> try adjusting these settings: Tools--Internet options--Advanced tab--Security section in the scroll menu.  Uncheck "untick  "check for server certificate revocation"

The following sites are still experiencing problems:

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Nexpress</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Working</span>
WorldCat Local ordering system
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SciFinder Scholar</span>﻿<span style="color: #ff0000;">Working</span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Factiva</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Working</span>

We're sorry for the inconvenience and hope to solve the problem as quickly as possible.
