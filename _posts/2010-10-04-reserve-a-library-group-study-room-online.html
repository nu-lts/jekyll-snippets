Starting today, as a result of student requests, we are pleased to announce that NU students can reserve a Snell Library group study room online. All of our twelve group study rooms are now open for reservations through an online self-booking resource on the Library's website that provides information on each roomâ€™s availability and size.

Simply go to <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/studyrooms" target="_blank">http://www.lib.neu.edu/studyrooms</a>, click on "Reserve It," and follow the instructions on the next page to complete your reservation. Snell group study rooms are limited to one per day per group, and can be reserved for up to three hours at a time. For more information about room reservations and self-service please call the Circulation Desk at 617-373-8778 or stop by the desk, on the first floor of Snell Library, for immediate assistance.
