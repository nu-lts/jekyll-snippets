Starting today, we are pleased to announce that NU students can reserve a Snell Library group study room online. All of our twelve group study rooms are now open for reservations through an online self-booking resource on the Library’s website that provides information on each room’s availability and size. 

Simply go to the Library home page and click on “Rooms &amp; Spaces” listed in the “Services” drop-down menu:  http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/rooms_and_spaces. 
Follow the step by step instructions at the top of the page to complete your reservation. Snell group study rooms are limited to one per day per group, and can be reserved for up to three hours at a time. For more information about room reservations please call (617-373-8778) or stop by the Circulation Desk on the first floor of Snell Library. We look forward to seeing you!
