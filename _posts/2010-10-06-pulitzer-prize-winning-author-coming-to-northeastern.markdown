**About _Tinkers_**

An old man lies dying. Propped up on a hospital bed in his living room and surrounded by his children and grandchildren, George Washington Crosby drifts in and out of consciousness, back to the wonder and pain of his impoverished childhood in Maine. As time becomes fluid, his memories intertwine with those of his father, an epileptic, itinerant peddler and his grandfather, a Methodist preacher beset by madness. At once heartbreaking and life affirming, _Tinkers_is an elegiac meditation on love, loss, illness, faith, and the fierce beauty of nature.  – From Bellevue Literary Press

_"Every so often a writer describes something so well ... that you can smell it or feel it or sense it in the room. The writing does what all those other art forms do -- evoke the essence of the thing." --_Susan Salter Reynold, Los Angeles Times**
