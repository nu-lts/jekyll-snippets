It's here! Today was the official opening of the <strong><a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/rooms_and_spaces/alumni_reading_room/" target="_blank">Anna &amp; Eugene M. Reppucci Alumni Reading Room</a></strong>. The room was a generous gift of Eugene M. Reppucci, Jr., an alumnus of Northeastern, donated in memory of his parents. The Reading Room will serve as a space for alumni to conduct personal research, relax, and experience the Library outside the bustle of the University. This room can also be reserved for alumni-related activities sponsored by student groups. There will be a reception in the Reading Room following the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/#RogerAbrams" target="_blank">author talk scheduled for Parents' Weekend</a>, October 23.

If you are interested in reserving the room for group functions, you can click <a title="here" href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/rooms_and_spaces/alumni_reading_room/reserve_alumni/" target="_blank">here</a> or email <a title="Tricia Reinhart" href="mailto:t.reinhart@neu.edu">Tricia Reinhart</a>.

To give the room a memorable opening, Paul Harding, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/19/books/19harding.html" target="_blank">Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winning author of <em>Tinkers</em></a>, treated the Library to a reading from his novel as well as a revelatory discussion about the process of his work and his experiences as a child that led him to the creation of <em><a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2296278~S13" target="_blank">Tinkers</a></em>.
