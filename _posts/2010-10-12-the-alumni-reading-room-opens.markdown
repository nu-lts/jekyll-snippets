It's here! Today was the official opening of the **[Anna & Eugene M. Reppucci Alumni Reading Room](http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/rooms_and_spaces/alumni_reading_room/)**. The room was a generous gift of Eugene M. Reppucci, Jr., an alumnus of Northeastern, donated in memory of his parents. The Reading Room will serve as a space for alumni to conduct personal research, relax, and experience the Library outside the bustle of the University. This room can also be reserved for alumni-related activities sponsored by student groups. There will be a reception in the Reading Room following the [author talk scheduled for Parents' Weekend](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/#RogerAbrams), October 23.

If you are interested in reserving the room for group functions, you can click [here](http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/rooms_and_spaces/alumni_reading_room/reserve_alumni/) or email [Tricia Reinhart](mailto:t.reinhart@neu.edu).

To give the room a memorable opening, Paul Harding, the [Pulitzer Prize-winning author of _Tinkers_](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/19/books/19harding.html), treated the Library to a reading from his novel as well as a revelatory discussion about the process of his work and his experiences as a child that led him to the creation of _[Tinkers](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2296278~S13)_.
