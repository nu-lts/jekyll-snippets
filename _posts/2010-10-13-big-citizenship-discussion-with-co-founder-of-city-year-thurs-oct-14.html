<em>"'Each time a man stands up for an  ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others,' Robert Kennedy famously wrote, 'he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope.' No one better exemplifies the truth of these words than Alan Khazei, the co-founder of City Year. In this stirring call to arms, Khazei lays out a path for the renewal of America, which should provoke conversation, debate and action.‚Äù</em> ---Doris Kearns Goodwin, Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winning author and presidential historian.
