**[Alan Khazei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Khazei)**, co-founder of [City Year](http://www.cityyear.org/) and CEO/founder of [Be the Change,  Inc.](http://www.bethechangeinc.org/), has written a new book -- **_Big Citizenship_** -- and is coming to campus to discuss the book and highlight Northeastern students who are Big Citizens.

_"'Each time a man stands up for an  ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others,' Robert Kennedy famously wrote, 'he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope.' No one better exemplifies the truth of these words than Alan Khazei, the co-founder of City Year. In this stirring call to arms, Khazei lays out a path for the renewal of America, which should provoke conversation, debate and action.‚Äù_ ---Doris Kearns Goodwin, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and presidential historian.
