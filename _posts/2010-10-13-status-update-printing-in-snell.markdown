The new printing system is up and running in Snell Library!  If you don't know what I'm talking about, the University has rolled out a [new print management system](http://www.northeastern.edu/infoservices/?p=5332) that includes Snell Library and the Infocommons.

On the public computers located on all four floors of Snell Library (five including the Archives on the lower level), you may log in to the computer using your myNEU username and password and print your work.  You may also print from the secure wireless network (connect to NUwave, not NUwave-guest).

Your printout will be released from the printers inside or just outside the Infocommons, depending on which one you selected, with a swipe of your Husky card.

There are eight (8) computers on the first floor that currently aren't printing, even if you log in...those have signs on them so you are warned!  And they should be fixed by tomorrow, 10/14.

If you experience any printing problems, such as your Husky card is not working, ask at the Help Desk in the Infocommons.

By the way, your 400-page quota was reset in the process of changing over to the new system, a nice lagniappe!
