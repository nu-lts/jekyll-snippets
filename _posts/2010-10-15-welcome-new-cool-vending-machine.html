This morning, a new vending machine showed up on the loading dock and installed itself (well, it's almost that smart!) <span style="color: #000000;"><del datetime="2011-10-03T14:13:27+00:00">on the first floor of Snell Library, just outside the CyberCafe.</del></span> <strong>Fall 2011 update: now on the Third Floor!</strong><em></em>

This machine can do everything but solve the extra credit question on your problem set:

Touch-screen display to select your junk food

Animated rotating picture of your bag of chips or beef jerky

Push a button for the ingredient list, or nutrition information (wait, 597 mg of sodium? Maaaybe not...)

Purchase with cash, <strong><em>or credit card!</em></strong>

This just might be cooler than the new printing system.Â  Thank you, Diji-Touch Interactive Vending, whoever you are!
