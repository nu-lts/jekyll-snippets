Open Access Week is a global event that highlights the movement to provide worldwide access to scholarly literature without the need for expensive journal subscriptions. You've probably heard of "think globally, act locally" in regard to environmentalism, but this way of thinking can also be applied to open access. By promoting a worldwide event like OA Week, we hope to inspire members of the Northeastern community to adopt an open access mindset where possible in their research, teaching, and campus activities.

I'll be writing a new blog post each day this week highlighting some of the work we're doing here at Northeastern to support open access as well as the amazing things that are going on at other colleges and universities. I hope you'll get inspired to learn more about how open access can dramatically improve the availability of information to everyone.

First, you probably know about [IRis, our digital archive of scholarship, publishing, and preservation](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/). (And if you _don't_ know about it, now's the time to find out!) But did you know that IRis contains over 1,700 items, from doctoral dissertations to undergraduate capstone projects to Faculty Senate meeting minutes? It's like a time capsule for the university that keeps getting more and more comprehensive each week. And all the materials in IRis are intended to be openly accessible to the entire world -- so it's not like one of those databases that asks you to sign in with your myNEU username and password from off-campus. That means we -- well, _you_, since it's your material in IRis -- get visitors to IRis from all over the world. It's a fantastic way to showcase your research to a global audience, and anyone at Northeastern can participate.

In a previous blog post, [I highlighted the impact IRis can have](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/index.php?p=1674) -- an article on Wired.com cited an undergraduate engineering capstone project, bringing the student group 300 downloads of their project in a single month!
