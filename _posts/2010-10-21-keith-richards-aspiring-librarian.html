In his just-released autobiography, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Keith-Richards/dp/031603438X" target="_blank">Life</a></em>, Keith Richards apparently confesses that he has always had a passion for collecting books and secretly wanted to be a librarian. In addition to the incongruity, I loved that he went so far as trying to learn to organize his personal collection according to the Dewey Decimal system but gave it up as too much of a hassle.  I suppose it's a good thing for all concerned that he never came over to the dark side, and stayed in the world of music where he clearly belongs!

Even as a child he loved books -- here's a quote via the (London) <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article7086815.ece" target="_blank">Times</a>:
<em>When you are growing up there are two institutional places that affect you most powerfully: the church, which belongs to God, and the public library, which belongs to you. The public library is a great equaliser.</em>

If this makes you want to watch/listen to some Stones, Martin Scorsese's concert film <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2220824~S13" target="_blank">Shine a Light</a> (2008) is on DVD at Snell, along with <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b1643157~S9" target="_blank">Gimme Shelter</a>, the film of the Altamont concert in 1969 on VHS for the hard-core fan. The reissue of <em>Exile on Main Street</em> (<a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2349641~S9" target="_blank">Rolling Stones: Stones in Exile</a>) is on order, and should be at Snell in a few days.

So Keith, how about coming to a "Meet the Author" talk at the library?
