They're working to redefine the current system of scholarly communication -- in which access to published research is limited to those at institutions that can afford to subscribe to expensive journals and databases. 

The huge expense of traditional subscription-based information is another issue driving the open access movement -- why should that information be limited to those who can afford it? And it's not cheap, either -- check out the introductory animation on RRC's homepage. You might be surprised that a subscription to ONE journal can be equal to or greater than a year's worth of tuition at Northeastern!  (See <a href="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/node/1102" target="_blank">Sticker Shock: The Price of Library Resources</a> for some price comparisons between journal subscriptions and big-ticket consumer items.)

To celebrate Open Access Week, the Right to Research Coalition is presenting a webcast tonight (Thursday, 10/21) at 7:00 pm Eastern time, in conjunction with UC Berkeley. You can find out more about it here: <a href="http://www.righttoresearch.org/blog/open-access-week-2010.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.righttoresearch.org/blog/open-access-week-2010.shtml</a>.
