The <a href="http://www.doaj.org/" target="_blank">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> lists 5,553 journals produced worldwide that are fully open access. But did you know that one of those journals is produced here at Northeastern University?

In 2007, faculty members Geoffrey Davies and Elham Ghabbour began publishing the <a href="http://iris.lib.neu.edu/aes/" target="_blank">Annals of Environmental Science</a>, a peer-reviewed, open access international journal for the environmental sciences. It's now publishing its fourth volume!

Some of our faculty authors have chosen to publish their research in open access journals -- for example, <a href="http://www.biology.neu.edu/faculty03/lewis03.html" target="_blank">Biology professor Kim Lewis</a> has been published in the prestigious Public Library of Science journals <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/adc/publications/tobiplosbio.pdf" target="_blank">PLoS Biology</a> and <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/adc/publications/sostobidorr.pdf" target="_blank">PLoS Genetics</a>.

Why not try publishing open-access yourself?
