[_Oxford Reference Online: Premium_](http://www.lib.neu.edu/databaseRedirects/oxfordreferenceRedirect.php) is an online collection consisting of over 200 award-winning and scholarly reference titles from Oxford University Press -- and it is now available at NU Libraries.

The addition of [_Oxford Reference Online: Premium_](http://www.lib.neu.edu/databaseRedirects/oxfordreferenceRedirect.php) to the Libraryâ€™s online collections is one of numerous, ongoing initiatives being taken by the Library to increase its support for the needs of students and faculty working or studying off campus or enrolled in distance courses.

Titles include companion volumes to specific subjects, like the _Oxford Companion to the Bible_; discipline-specific dictionaries and encyclopedias, for example _The Encyclopedia of Mammals_; a good number of English and foreign language dictionaries; and grammar and style manuals.

These reference works may be searched either individually or as a group in a single, unified search. Titles are arranged either alphabetically or in clear subject categories.
