[Three research journals from the NCTE](http://0-www.ncte.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu) (National Council of Teachers of English)  are now available electronically through the NU Libraries:


[College Composition and Communication](http://0-www.ncte.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/cccc/ccc/issues) focusing on practical strategies for teaching based on the latest research and theory




[Language Arts](http://0-www.ncte.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/journals/la/issues), a magazine for those who teach elementary and middle school writing




[Research in the Teaching of English](http://0-www.ncte.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/journals/rte/issues) for original research and scholarly essays on teaching English at all levels


I've been enjoying looking at these as I reflect on how I was taught to write, and on the NU Libraries' support for [First Year](http://subjectguides.lib.neu.edu/content.php?pid=140410) and[ Advanced Writing in the Disciplines](http://subjectguides.lib.neu.edu/awd) programs at NU.  Of all the skills I learned in school and college, writing has been the most important, hands down.

What do you think helps students learn to write?  Do you find the essays in the NCTE journals helpful? Practical? Provocative?
