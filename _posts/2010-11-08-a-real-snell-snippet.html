One of my professors let me in on a little-known secret about Snell Library; it is partially funded by federal dollars through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Depository_Library_Program">Federal Depository Library Program</a> (FDLP). The FDLP is a program that disseminates U.S.  Government information to the American public through libraries across  the nation. As one of two selective depositories for the district, Snell Library receives forty-five percent of  the federal publication series available to depository libraries. It chooses the governmental material most applicable to the University and the surrounding populace it serves. Much of this material is now sent via the internet, but written publications and disks are also sent to Northeastern.

In a review of Snell Library in FDLP's <a href="http://www.fdlp.gov/outreach/spotlight/813-snell-library-at-northeastern-university"> Depository Library Spotlight, </a> Snell was commended for the easy access and visibility of the content in its depository:
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>"Snell Library does not simply meet the minimum legal and program  requirements for promoting access to their depository collection. To the  contrary, the library makes every effort to ensure not only that the  depository collection is visible, but that all users are welcome to  access tangible and online materials alike.  For any library to embrace  the spirit of the Federal Depository Library Program to the extent that  Snell has is commendable. All depositories looking to emphasize free  access by all users need only follow the example set by the Snell  Library at Northeastern University."</em></p>
