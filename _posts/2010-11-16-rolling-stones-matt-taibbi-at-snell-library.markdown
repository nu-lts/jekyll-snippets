Tomorrow, Wednesday, November 17th, _Rolling Stone_ columnist Matt Taibbi will be featured in Snell Library's Meet the Author series with his new book [_Griftopia_](http://www.amazon.com/Griftopia-Machines-Vampire-Breaking-America/dp/0385529953). Come for refreshments and a lot of laughs. [Matt Taibbi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Taibbi) takes a humorous and at times very serious stance on just about all of the big headlines of the news. Notorious for his political comments, Matt wrote _[Griftopia](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2352891~S13)_ to report the inside scoop on America's failing economy and who's to blame. Come to learn about all of the latest struggles America is facing and some that undoubtedly will be challenges for the future. Want a taste? Check out his blog on [True/Slant](http://trueslant.com/matttaibbi/) for a small dose of the excitement about to come. You can purchase a book at the event and even get it signed. Don't forget to bring your questions and/or rants!

This event is sponsored by NU Libraries and the NU Bookstore.
