As usual, Snell is keeping up with the times and mobile technology is an area we wouldn't want to miss out on. So don't be surprised if you start seeing some of these little numbers popping up around Snell or elsewhere on campus. If you have a barcode scanner on your smartphone, try this QR code out and let us know what you think! (Of course, you can also access our mobile website at this address: [http://www.lib.neu.edu/m](http://www.lib.neu.edu/m))
