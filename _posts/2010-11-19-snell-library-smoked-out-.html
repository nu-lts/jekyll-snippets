What comes to mind when I say cigarettes? Cigarette smoke. 2nd-hand smoke. Carcinogens. Cancer. The entrance to Snell Library. And with the great things that science has revealed to us about cigarettes you would think we'd see a change... but no. Cigarettes are a staple of human consumption, always have been and most likely always will. Now step back before you start thinking I'm some passionately crazy anti-cigarette wacko. I've enjoyed my share of cigs and though I choose not to buy them anymore, I can still appreciate coffee and a cigarette in the sun.
<p style="text-align: left;">What I don't appreciate is heading into or out of the library and having to pass through a thick smokescreen of a unique mixture of Camel, Marlboro, and Virginia Slims. Signs are clearly posted "Do not smoke near the entrance," yet there are ash-trays right in front of the doors and nobody is ever asked to relocate when smoking there.</p>

I don't blame the smokers, I don't really blame anyone.

This is something that has bugged me since coming here 2 years ago. If it's not raining, take the cigarette a few more steps down and sit on a bench. If it is raining or snowing, walk around the new Alumni Reading Room to the bike-rack side where not every person has to come through. Simple, effective, and who loses out? No one. I think a little education and enforcement would go a long way to make the entrance to Snell much cleaner.
