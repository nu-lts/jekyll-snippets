Here at Snell we are always looking for new online research tools that would be useful to the Northeastern community. They are often expensive, however, and so we usually try them out before we buy them. You can always see what's currently on trial by going to the [All Databases and Trials](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/) page and clicking on the link that says "[check out our current database trials](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1)." (Also, note the [evaluation form](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/evaluation/) on that page -- be sure to fill that out so we can have your feedback on these resources!)

Right now we have some very interesting products on trial. To welcome Dr. Lori Lefkovitz, the new director of Northeastern's [Jewish Studies Program](http://www.jewishstudies.neu.edu/), we have a couple of Jewish Studies resources to sample. The [Index to Jewish Periodicals](http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?authtype=ip,uid&profile=ehost&defaultdb=jph) provides access to English-language articles and book reviews on Jewish history, activity, and thought in more than 220 journals devoted to Jewish affairs, with coverage back to 1988. [Jewish Studies Source](http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/login.aspx?authtype=ip,uid&profile=ehost&defaultdb=jss) offers a multidisciplinary view into the study of Jewish civilization from its historical origins to the present, drawing across multiple areas of study, and contains much full text (over 350 titles). Both resources are available to try out until the end of 2010.

Another new tool you can try is [Sage Research Methods Online](http://0-srmo.sagepub.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/). This resource provides full text for more than 500 books and several encyclopedias offering relevant research methods content across the social and behavioral sciences, covering quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods (it includes the well-known QASS or Little Green Book Series). You can try this until the end of 2010.

Finally, an interesting departure from our usual resources: [Global Road Warrior](http://0-www.globalroadwarrior.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/directclient_index2.asp?c=neu). According to its description, this is "a source for practical travel information and intercultural communication. You may want to make use of it to get acclimated to a country's business culture and etiquette (greetings & courtesies, ethics, meetings, attire), society and culture (gift giving, food, media, time & punctuality) and travel tips (money & banking, transportation, and more) for 200+ countries." This sounds like it would be great for students heading off to study-abroad programs or international co-op jobs. Global Road Warrior is on trial until January 9, 2011.

Remember, when you test out any of the products on trial, be sure to fill out our [feedback form](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/evaluation/) letting us know what you thought!
