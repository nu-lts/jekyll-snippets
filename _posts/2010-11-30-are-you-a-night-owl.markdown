Do you use the library overnight? If so, did you know that library materials are now available for you to check out, even after the circulation desk is closed? Try our new self-service overnight check-out and let us know what you think: [http://www.lib.neu.edu/contact_us/](http://www.lib.neu.edu/contact_us/)

Make sure to hang on to your receipt--it's the only way security guards will know your items were checked out. Questions? Give us a call at 617-373-8778 or just stop by the circulation desk to say hello.
