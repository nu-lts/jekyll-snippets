A week from today, on December 8th, the <a href="../../about_us/digital_media/" target="_blank">Digital Media Design Studio</a> will celebrate the opening of a new student photo exhibit. The photography collection, <em>Adverse Collaboration</em>, will be unveiled and on display through February 2011 and will feature the work of Joyce Lin and Misha Thomas, two student photographers with very different styles.  Their pictures will display contrasting world views and lifestyles through images of New England and Ghana.

Accompanying the unveiling will be a performance by the <a href="http://www.noreaster.neu.edu/" target="_blank">Nor'easters</a> who are releasing their new CD, "Aural Fixation."  The <a href="http://www.noreaster.neu.edu/" target="_blank">Nor'easters</a> are the premier co-ed a capella group at Northeastern University, and also the oldest student group on campus.  “Aural Fixation” is 100% Northeastern-made, recorded in Northeastern University studios with the help of other NU students.  All of the photography and promotion for the CD has also been made through the efforts of the Nor'easters, their fans, and fellow students.

Be sure to attend this special event, Fixation Collaboration, and support the work of your peers! <strong>It's all happening on Wednesday, December 8 from 11:45am to 1:30pm in the DMDS, located at 200 Snell.  Refreshments will be served.</strong>
