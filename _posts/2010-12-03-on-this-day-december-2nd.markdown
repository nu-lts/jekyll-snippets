Today marks the 40th anniversary of the [United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](http://www.epa.gov/40th/). On December 2nd, 1970 (40 years ago!) the EPA began daily operations under Richard Nixon (one of few things he got right). This organization is responsible for researching and educating the public on environmental issues, as well as setting and enforcing environment-related legislation. Key programs you may be familiar with are vehicle emission standards, Clean Water Acts, and the Endangered Species Acts.

As a part of NU Libraries' Federal Depository program, we have government-issued reports available in print and online that explore various EPA related topics in detail. You can take out a print article from our government stacks on the [oversight of recent EPA decisions](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13?/Xepa&SORT=D/Xepa&SORT=D&SUBKEY=epa/1%2C777%2C777%2CE/frameset&FF=Xepa&SORT=D&1%2C1%2C), or you can read an online article on the [EPA lifecycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2356811~S13). There is much to choose from, so celebrate 40 years by taking a look at these resources. To view the library's entire EPA collection, keyword search "EPA" in [NUCat](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu).
