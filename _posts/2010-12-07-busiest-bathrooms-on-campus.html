Not to brag, but I think the Library tops the charts in terms of traffic in our restrooms making our bathrooms the busiest on campus! We try our best so that you can't tell.

To keep up with the number of bathroom visitors this Fall, NU House and Grounds have stepped up their efforts to keep the facilities clean with more frequent service (and a record of when itâ€™s been provided), paper-free hand driers designed to be both green and mess eliminators, and the installation of locks on bathroom doors to ensure a really thorough cleaning. That being said, cleanliness is a joint effort amongst all library users - students, faculty, staff, etc.

While bathroom etiquette seems like a no-brainer there have been some  interesting messes in the past. Here are some tips on how to make sure  the restrooms stay user friendly :)

1. Do not dispose of food in the toilets or anything besides what is intended of being disposed in a toilet.

2. Avoid pressing the 'flush' button with your foot. This damages the flushing mechanism. Here's a tip! Use a piece of toilet paper to press the button so you avoid touching it with your hand.

3. Paper, paper, paper. Please, be green and take only what you need. Do not leave paper on the floor, use the trash can.

4. Shut off the water when you are done using the sink. If you spill, pick up after yourself.

5. And finally, if you see a problem, report it. Call x2754 (NU Work Control) or submit a request online at <a href="http://www.workreq.neu.edu/">www.workreq.neu.edu</a>.
