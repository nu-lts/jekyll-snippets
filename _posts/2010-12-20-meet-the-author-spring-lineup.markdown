The Library's popular "Meet the Author" series continues this spring with an exciting and varied lineup of writers.

Here's a sneak peek at some of the authors we've booked to come to Snell Library this spring:

Micah Nathan opens the spring series on January 27, reading from [Losing Graceland](http://amzn.com/0307591352), a picaresque novel about a down-on-his-luck college student's road trip to Memphis with an elderly man -- who may or may not be Elvis!

![Your Creative Brain](https://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&Password=neuniv&Return=1&type=S&Value=9780470547632&Options=Y)

On March 9, psychologist Shelley Carson talks about [Your Creative Brain](http://amzn.com/0470547634), a book about how to strengthen your brain to develop your creative side, with an emphasis on understanding what kind of brain you have and what techniques work best for you.

On March 16, Patrick Rothfuss brings us [The Wise Man's Fear](http://amzn.com/0756404738), a fantasy novel that tells the story of the growth and development of a hero. It's the eagerly-anticipated second in a projected trilogy (the Kingkiller Chronicles), following the immensely popular [Name of the Wind](http://amzn.com/075640407X).

![Hot Stuff](https://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&Password=neuniv&Return=1&type=S&Value=9780393066753&Options=Y)

If you're young enough to have just missed the baby boom you probably have fond (or not so fond!) memories of the disco era. In which case, you'll enjoy hearing Alice Echols discuss [Hot Stuff: Disco and the Remaking of American Culture](http://amzn.com/0393066754) on March 30. If nothing else, she rehabilitates the great [_Saturday Night Fever_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b1513656~S13) to its rightful place in the American film pantheon.

We'll be making more announcements as we move closer to the dates. And we hope you'll join us for this exciting series of authors!
