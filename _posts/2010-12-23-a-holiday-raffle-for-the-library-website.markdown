[![](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/smallgift3.jpg)](http://www.loop11.com/usability-test/4325/introduction/)Test the library website for a chance to win!

We are redesigning our website to make it as navigable and user-friendly as possible.Â In order to ensure this, we would like to hear from you.

We are hosting an online survey and usability test of our current website, which should take about **10-15 minutes to complete**. We invite you to tell all! There are no wrong answers and all responses are confidential.

For your participation, you will be entered to win either our first prize of a $50 gift card to the NU Bookstore, or our second prize of a $15 gift card to iTunes.

If you are interested in participating and entering the raffle, please **[take the survey and usability test](http://www.loop11.com/usability-test/4325/introduction/) before January 5th, 2011.**

Thanks for your participation!
