One question we get a lot at the Research Assistance desk is, "Where can I send a fax?" We don't have a fax machine for student use in the library, but here are two options on campus:

⇒ **Ell Building Copy Center** (NU Reprographics)
Cost: $1.50 for 1st page; 50 cents for each additional page
Hours of operation: M-F 7:30 a.m.-6:00 p.m.
Phone number: 617-373-5646
