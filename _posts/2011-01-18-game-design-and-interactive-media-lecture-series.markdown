Today, January 18, at 1:30pm there will be a lecture in the Raytheon Amphitheater (240 Egan) by Ed Fries.

Ed Fries is awesome because he is co-creator of the Xbox, the creator of "Halo 2600" for the Atari 2600, founder of FingerPrints, and is a former Microsoft Vice President of Game Publishing.

This event is open to both students and professionals in the area and should be an amazing talk with Mr. Fries. If you are interested in game design, interactive media, animation, or if you have just played on an Xbox before you should attend!

Also, this lecture is part of an ongoing event series by the Creative Industries Program and College of Arts called the [2011 Game Design and Interactive Media Lecture Series](http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/about/events_items/spring2011/creativelectures.html). Keep an eye out for more terrific events like this in the future!

UPDATE, 5:10pm, 1/18/11: Unfortunately, this event was cancelled due to bad weather. Hopefully it will be rescheduled. Check the [lecture series' website](http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/about/events_items/spring2011/creativelectures.html) for further updates.
