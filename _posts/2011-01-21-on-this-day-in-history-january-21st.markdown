On this day in history, the great author George Orwell died in London. Perhaps best known for his dystopian novel [1984](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b1472560~S13), George Orwell was a proponent of social justice in his time. Today we read his books and take from them the lessons of equality, freedom, and justice that were being expressed in the 1940s. The library has a great collection of books, videos, e-books, and more that you can find [here](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S13/?searchtype=a&searcharg=orwell&searchscope=13&SORT=D&extended=1&SUBMIT=Search&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=ageorge+orwell), or by searching for George Orwell on NUCat. Take some time out to read or re-read some of the 20th century's finest literary works!
