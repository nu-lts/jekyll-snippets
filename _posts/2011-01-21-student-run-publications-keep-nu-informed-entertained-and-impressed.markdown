It's pretty common for universities to have a student-run newspaper and a yearbook, and ours, of course, are excellent. But until I started compiling this list, I didn't realize what a wide variety of other student publications we have on campus. They showcase student research, journalism, literary and artistic talent, and more. (And they're practically indistinguishable from professionally produced magazines that have much bigger budgets and staffs that aren't also going to school full-time.)

About: _"ECONPress is a student-run undergraduate research publication  that is published twice a year at the beginning of each fall and spring semesters. Each issue features the best economic research of undergraduate students in the local Boston area. ECONPress provides a forum for the economic undergraduate community to engage in active discussion and debate about the topics, theories, and applications they've learned in the classroom. Students may submit within three different categories: articles, essays, and research papers. In addition to the publication, ECONPress hosts a biannual conference where authors will have a chance to present their research to the local economic community. Invited authors featured in ECONPress will have the opportunity to present their findings as part of an itinerary that includes a prominent economist. At ECONPress we hope to assist in the preparation of the next generation of economists by providing current undergraduate students a resource to experience and engage in a significant part of the professional research field."_

Or, if there are student-run publications (either print or online) that aren't in this post at all, leave a comment about that, too!
