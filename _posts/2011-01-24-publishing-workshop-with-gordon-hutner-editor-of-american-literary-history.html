Students in the humanities should consider attending this event on Thursday, January 27th. Even if you're not an English major or grad student, if you're considering a career in research and publishing in the humanities, I recommend hearing what Dr. Hutner will share about what goes into publishing a scholarly journal!

Here are the full details of the event, from the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/calendar/?trumbaEmbed=view%3devent%26eventid%3d92885931" target="_blank">NU calendar</a>:

440 Egan Research Center
Thursday, January 27, 2011, 12 â€“ 1:15pm

Professor Gordon Hutner, a distinguished scholar of American literature and founding editor of the journal <em>American Literary History</em>, will be conducting a publication workshop to discuss how to publish work in a journal such as <em>ALH</em>. This is an incredible opportunity for students to meet an important figure in the field and to receive an inside view of the publication process.

Prof. Hutner will also deliver a talk the same afternoon as part of the Barrs Lecture Series. The talk is titled "The 21st Century American Novel: A History" and will be held at 5:30 p.m. in 340 Egan.

Please plan to attend both of these events, and come prepared for lively and valuable discussions.
