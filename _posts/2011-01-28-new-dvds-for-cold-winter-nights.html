I've just updated this week's New Titles in Snell Library, and I noticed we've got a nice crop of new DVDs.

<strong>If you like biopics,</strong> there's <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361455" target="_blank">Temple Grandin</a>, about an autistic woman who becomes a pioneer in animal psychology.

<strong>Hipsters?</strong> Catch Julie Christie in <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361400~S18" target="_blank">Darling</a> (1965), about an English model and her descent into corruption. Or for those who like the classics, watch <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S18?/tNinotchka+/tninotchka/1%2C1%2C2%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=tninotchka&amp;2%2C%2C2/indexsort=-" target="_blank">Ninotchka</a> (1939), a lighthearted comedy about visitors to Paris who ascend into corruption (Garbo laughs!).

<strong>For date night,</strong> borrow <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361471" target="_blank">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</a>, based on a graphic novel about what it takes to win the girl of your dreams. A more serious take on love would be <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361448" target="_blank">Vincere</a> ("Win", 2009) about the love between Benito Mussolini and Ida Dalser (in Italian), or <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361395" target="_blank">Un Coeur en Hiver</a> ("A Heart in Winter", 2006), centering on the love triangle between a concert violinist, her lover, and his best friend (in, you guessed it, French).

<strong>Working your way through this year's Oscar nominees?</strong> Our newest arrival is the comedy-drama <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361467" target="_blank">The Kids Are All Right</a> (2010), with great acting from Annette Bening and Julianne Moore as lesbian parents of two teenage kids.

Another family drama, <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361456" target="_blank">Please Give</a> (2010), explores the dynamics of a Manhattan family waiting for their neighbor to die so they can take over and renovate her apartment.

<strong>Every week we update our lists of <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/new_titles/" target="_blank">New Titles</a>.</strong> You can browse the lists, or subscribe to the RSS feed, depending on your interests. Choose a subject like mathematics, or you can view new videos or new titles from our high-interest award-winning titles in the first floor Hub reading area.
