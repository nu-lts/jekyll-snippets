I've just updated this week's New Titles in Snell Library, and I noticed we've got a nice crop of new DVDs.

**If you like biopics,** there's [Temple Grandin](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361455), about an autistic woman who becomes a pioneer in animal psychology.

**Hipsters?** Catch Julie Christie in [Darling](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361400~S18) (1965), about an English model and her descent into corruption. Or for those who like the classics, watch [Ninotchka](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S18?/tNinotchka+/tninotchka/1%2C1%2C2%2CE/frameset&FF=tninotchka&2%2C%2C2/indexsort=-) (1939), a lighthearted comedy about visitors to Paris who ascend into corruption (Garbo laughs!).

**For date night,** borrow [Scott Pilgrim vs. The World](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361471), based on a graphic novel about what it takes to win the girl of your dreams. A more serious take on love would be [Vincere](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361448) ("Win", 2009) about the love between Benito Mussolini and Ida Dalser (in Italian), or [Un Coeur en Hiver](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361395) ("A Heart in Winter", 2006), centering on the love triangle between a concert violinist, her lover, and his best friend (in, you guessed it, French).

**Working your way through this year's Oscar nominees?** Our newest arrival is the comedy-drama [The Kids Are All Right](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361467) (2010), with great acting from Annette Bening and Julianne Moore as lesbian parents of two teenage kids.

Another family drama, [Please Give](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2361456) (2010), explores the dynamics of a Manhattan family waiting for their neighbor to die so they can take over and renovate her apartment.

**Every week we update our lists of [New Titles](http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/new_titles/).** You can browse the lists, or subscribe to the RSS feed, depending on your interests. Choose a subject like mathematics, or you can view new videos or new titles from our high-interest award-winning titles in the first floor Hub reading area.
