**_Freedom
_**By Jonathan Franzen
[PS3556.R352 F74 2010](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S19/?searchtype=c&searcharg=PS3556.R352+F74+2010&searchscope=19&SORT=D&extended=1&SUBMIT=Search&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=iPS3556.R352+F74+2010)

Touted by critics as a "masterpiece of American Literature," and compared in _Esquire_ magazine to Tolstoy’s classic _War and Peace_, _Freedom_ is a darkly written comedy framed through the envious eyes of an American family’s moralistic neighbors. The book paints an insightful portrait of the cultural forces and individual choices that can bring families together—and tear them apart. Selected for several book lists, _Freedom _was not without controversy. Boston's WBUR reported that several best-selling female authors, including Jodi Picoult, believed the critical praise for Franzen's book was merely misplaced gender bias. Check out _Freedom_ for yourself to discover if the book is worth the wide acclaim.

**_Room
_**By Emma Donoghue
[PR6054.O547 R66 2010](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S19?/cPR6054.O547+R66+2010/cpr+6054+o547+r66+2010/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FF=cpr+6054+o547+r66+2010&1%2C1%2C)

Jack, like other five-year-old boys, plays with his toys and loves his mom, but he lives a life quite different from other children. He has spent his entire life in a small room with his mother as a prisoner of a man called Old Nick. Despite the disturbing premise, _Room_ is a story of endurance, filled with raw emotional extremes that make readers feel like they too are discovering the world for the first time. Winner of the Hughes & Hughes Irish Novel of the Year and the Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize, _Room_ is a strange but powerful novel.

_**A Visit from the Goon Squad**_
By Jennifer Egan
[PS3555.G292 V57 2010
](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S19?/cPS3555.G292+V57+2010/cps+3555+g292+v57+2010/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FF=cps+3555+g292+v57+2010&1%2C1%2C)
Punk rock laced with obscenities? Sign us up, please. Jennifer Egan's book starts in modern day New York before flashing back to the early Bay Area punk scene to follow the life of Sasha, a child of a broken, violent marriage who runs away and ends up in the radically new music scene of the late 1970s and early '80s. _A Visit from the Goon Squad_ is more than just sex and rock and roll—it's rich with satire and clever prose. Pick up the book today to give this Brooklyn-based author a spin on the turntable.

**Non-fiction**

**_Apollo's Angels: A History of Ballet_**
By Jennifer Homans
[GV1787 .H58 2010](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S19?/cGV1787+.H58+2010/cgv+1787+h58+2010/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FF=cgv+1787+h58+2010&1%2C1%2C)

Homans, former professional ballet dancer and current dance critic for _The New Republic_, chronicles the formal and cultural history of ballet in her two-part work _Apollo's Angels_. It is partly a celebration of the ballet's most notable achievements and its cultural importance, but Homans also questions its survival as its relevance gradually fades. Written before [_Black Swan_ ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/)revived the public's interest in ballet, it's a fascinating exposition of a purportedly languishing art form.

**_Cleopatra: A Life_**
By Stacy Schiff
[DT92.7 .S35 2010](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S19?/cDT92.7+.S35+2010/cdt+++92.7+s35+2010/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FF=cdt+++92.7+s35+2010&1%2C1%2C)

Countless literary and film portrayals present Cleopatra as a bold, manipulative seductress, but they neglect to credit her as a brilliant politician and leader, according to author Stacy Schiff. The author, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2000 for her biography of Vera Nabokov, the wife of _Lolita _author Vladimir Nabokov, dispels the myths surrounding the legendary queen of Egypt while also crafting a "bloody and harrowing" portrait of the royal family.

**_The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer_**
By Siddhartha Mukherjee
[RC275 .M85 2010 ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S19?/cRC275+.M85+2010/crc++275+m85+2010/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FF=crc++275+m85+2010&1%2C1%2C)

In his debut work, oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee writes a "biography" of one of our time's most pervasive and misunderstood illnesses: cancer. It provides detailed accounts of our society's battle against the disease and the gripping stories behind the treatments and breakthroughs we know today. Mukherjee shows us how far we have come in understanding this "emperor of all maladies," but he also recognizes how little we actually know.

**_Finishing the Hat: Collected Lyrics (1954-1981) With Attendant Comments, Principles, Heresies, Grudges, Whines and Anecdotes_**
By Stephen Sondheim
[ML54.6.S69 S66 2010 ](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S19?/cML54.6.S69+S66+2010/cml+++54.6+s69+s66+2010/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FF=cml+++54.6+s69+s66+2010&1%2C1%2C)

_Finishing the Hat_, which is part self-critique and part illumination, analyzes lyricist Stephen Sondheim's earlier works, including _[West Side Story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_Story)_, _[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Funny_Thing_Happened_on_the_Way_to_the_Forum)_, and _[Sweeney Todd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweeney_Todd:_The_Demon_Barber_of_Fleet_Street_(musical))_. The title refers to a line from Sondheim's 1984 musical _[Sunday in the Park with George](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_in_the_Park_with_George)_, where painter Georges Seurat is moments away from completing his grand work, "[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte](http://www.artic.edu/artaccess/AA_Impressionist/pages/IMP_7.shtml)." _Finishing the Hat_ provides great insight into the creative process of our generation's most gifted composers.

**_The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration_**
By Isabel Wilkerson
[E185.6 .W685 2010](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S19?/cE185.6+.W685+2010/ce+++185.6+w685+2010/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FF=ce+++185.6+w685+2010&1%2C1%2C)

When George Swanson Sterling, an orange grove worker in Florida, became aware he was a potential lynching victim, he fled the area for Harlem in 1945. Beginning in the 20th century and peaking in the post-WWII years, more than six million African Americans left the South to escape Jim Crow-era brutality for areas with industrial job opportunities. Wilkerson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, culminates fourteen years of research in her work, _The Warmth of Other Suns_. She details the journeys of three individuals who made the trek from the American South to Wisconsin, California, and New York, respectively. Sterling's story and others' provide fascinating insight into the historical migration that shaped and enriched the culture of our major urban areas in the North and West, and consequently, our country.
