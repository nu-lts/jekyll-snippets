In my last post about the availability of the 2010 Springer E-Book collection, I outlined some of the advantages of e-books over the print -- 24/7 multi-user access, support for distance users, powerful and granular searching, suitability for reserve, and more.

To expand our e-book offerings, we’ve now leased access to a core collection of over 50,000 e-books from the past several years -- a collection called <strong>Academic Complete</strong> and hosted on the <strong>ebrary</strong> e-book site. We’re providing this collection on a trial basis this year to see how well the titles are used and to gather feedback from you.

The Academic Complete collection is multidisciplinary, covering a variety of subject areas in the humanities, social sciences, business, medicine, and science, and offers a large number of titles from leading academic publishers. Over half of the collection dates from 2004 and later. Special features include:

* Powerful searching across all of the e-books or all e-books in specific discipline areas
* Complete full-text searching, including indexes and tables of contents
* Ability to navigate directly to your highlighted search results within a title
* Ability to browse through a book, or to navigate via the table of contents or index
* Ability to browse titles by discipline and drill down to specific subject areas
* Automatic generation of citations and persistent links to titles, chapters, and individual pages
* Ability to add highlighting and notes to text and save in your personal online bookshelf
* Convenient printing and copying
* Easy export of information to EndNote or RefWorks citation managers
* Text-to-speech and other accessibility features

<strong>You can go directly to the <a href="http://0-site.ebrary.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/lib/northeastern" target="_blank">ebrary</a> site to search or browse this collection</strong>. You’ll also find the individual titles listed in <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/" target="_blank">NuCat</a>. By the way, on the main search or <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search/X" target="_blank">advanced search</a> screens in NuCat, did you know that you can now limit searches to e-books only? Instead of "View Entire Collection," simply select "Ebooks."

I hope you enjoy using our new e-book collection. Your comments are welcome and important to us; you can comment on this post, contact your subject librarian, or you can reach me any time at  <a href="mailto:a.aaron@neu.edu">a.aaron@neu.edu</a>.
