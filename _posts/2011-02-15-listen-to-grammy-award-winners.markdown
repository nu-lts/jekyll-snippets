There were some surprises last night at the Grammy Awards, and you'll be surprised that some of the award-winners and their recordings can be found at the Snell Library, too!

The best new artist of the year, Esperanza Spalding, is featured on a 4-DVD set available at the Snell Library called "[Icons Among us: Jazz in the Present Tense](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2283961)."

For pop and r&b artists, we may not have the winning recordings but we do have some CDs and DVDs featuring[ Jeff Beck](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S17/?searchtype=X&searcharg=jeff+beck&searchscope=17&sortdropdown=-&SORT=DZ&extended=1&SUBMIT=Search&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=Xjeff+beck%26SORT%3DD), [Eminem](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b1646436), [John Legend](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S17/?searchtype=a&searcharg=legend+john&searchscope=17&sortdropdown=-&SORT=D&extended=1&SUBMIT=Search&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=alegend+john), and [Neil Young](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S9/?searchtype=X&SORT=D&searcharg=neil+young&searchscope=17). Intriguingly, we happen to have a [recording by the Nor'easters, Northeastern's a cappella group](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2366530~S19), of a Lady Gaga medley.

In the classical category, you can find the multi-award winning [Metropolis Symphony and Deus Ex Machina by Michael Daugherty](http://0-neu.naxosmusiclibrary.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/catalogue/item.asp?cid=8.559635) (Best Engineered Classical, Best Orchestral Performance, Best Classical Contemporary) streaming online from Naxos. I admit I have my issues with contemporary classical but I really liked Metropolis (which is based on the Superman Comics) a lot; it has great energy and is modern in the best sense, with echoes of Gershwin.

Naxos also streams the Parker Quartet's [Ligeti's String Quartets Nos. 1 and 2](http://0-neu.naxosmusiclibrary.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/catalogue/item.asp?cid=8.570781) (Best Chamber Music Performance) and P. Jacobs' organ recording of [Messiaen's Livre du Saint Sacrement](http://0-neu.naxosmusiclibrary.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/catalogue/item.asp?cid=8.572436-37) (Best Instrumental Soloist).

We've also got recordings by these award-winners:
