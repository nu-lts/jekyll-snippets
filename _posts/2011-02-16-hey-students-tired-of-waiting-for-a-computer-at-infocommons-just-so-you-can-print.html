You should try wireless printing! Thanks to NU Information Services, you can download a software client to your personal computer that enables remote printing on-campus and off-campus.

To get the software, log into your <a href="http://myneu.neu.edu" target="_blank">myNEU</a> account while on your personal computer and follow these steps:

1. Click on the <strong>'Self-Service'</strong> tab. Under the <strong>'Study and Course Resources,'</strong> find  the <strong>'Software Downloads'</strong> link.

2. Choose <strong>'Virtual Print Client for Free Print Allowance System'</strong> for your computer (Windows or Mac).

3. Follow the installation instructions. When you print your file, select the <strong>"HP BW"</strong> printer (for jobs with 30 pages or less) or <strong>"Canon High Volume"</strong> for jobs with more than 30 pages.

4. The print job will stay in queue for 36 hours, and it can be printed at one of the InfoCommons printing stations in that 36-hour period.

If you have Windows, there's the option for a 32bit client and 64bit client. Most computers will use a 32bit, but if you're not sure which one you need, or if you have any other questions, call the Help Desk at 617-373-4357.
