From time to time, I like to feature an object in <a href="http://iris.lib.neu.edu" target="_blank">IRis</a>, our digital archive of research and scholarship at Northeastern, that's been getting a lot of hits. I get a weekly report e-mailed to me of the most frequently accessed content in IRis, and there's one honors project that's been appearing near the top of that weekly list for quite a while now. <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2047/d10001281" target="_blank">"Profiling Pros and Cons: An Evaluation of Contemporary Criminal Profiling Methods"</a> was submitted by Theresa M. Young in fulfillment of the Honors Program's Junior/Senior Project requirement in 2006. In the past year, it's been accessed 546 times, making it the second most-accessed document in IRis!

We use Google Analytics to track usage of both the library website and IRis, and there's a lot of fascinating information to be found in those metrics. For example, almost 81% of visitors found Theresa's project through Google searches; the most commonly searched phrase that brought them to her project was "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=&amp;q=criminal+profiling+pros+and+cons" target="_blank">criminal profiling pros and cons</a>," where it's the top result. Although the majority of visitors came from the United States, people in a total of 18 countries accessed Theresa's project. I found it particularly noteworthy that of the 5 visits from Iraq, 3 of them came via the Department of Defense. Is Theresa's research having an impact on criminal justice in Iraq? Regardless of how it's being used, the popularity and relevance of her work, both in the US and around the world, is undeniable.

(After graduating from Northeastern in 2006, Theresa Young went on to law school at the University of Richmond. While there, she served as Executive Editor of the <em>Richmond Journal of Law and the Public Interest</em>.)
