Snell Library is creating a **_THEN and NOW_ **display on the first floor and we will be accepting submissions for best **NOW image**. Please submit your own artwork that captures Snell Library as you see it today, in our 20th year. Photographs, paintings, sketches, etc. are all welcome. Submit your NOW-themed entries by 8pm on Wednesday, February 23rd for a chance to be **featured in our March/April display** and a **chance to win a $5 iTunes gift card**! Submissions should include your name, major, graduation year, and email address.  All questions and submissions can be sent to Jessie Contour at j.contour@neu.edu or dropped off in 242 Snell Library.
