This month and all months, we honor the African diaspora and the many contributions of African-Americans. The Northeastern University community is fortunate to have two related experts to help us to learn more about African American history. <a title="Kantigi Camara" href="http://www.northeastern.edu/aai/library.html" target="_blank">Kantigi Camara</a> is the Librarian who runs the <a title="John D. O'Bryant African-American Institute Library" href="http://www.northeastern.edu/aai/library2.html" target="_blank">John D. O'Bryant African-American Institute Library</a>. And Research &amp; Instruction Librarian Christine Oka designed this <a title="African American Studies Research Guide" href="http://subjectguides.lib.neu.edu/africanamerican" target="_blank">research guide</a>. She also provides reference assistance and manages a related collection at Snell Library. Additionally, here is a gorgeous <a title="Library of Congress: African American History Month" href="http://www.africanamericanhistorymonth.gov/" target="_blank">website</a> celebrating Black History Month, which was put together by the Library of Congress.
