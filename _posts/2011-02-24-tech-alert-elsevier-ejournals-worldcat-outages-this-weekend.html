Add this to your reasons to get out of Boston and go skiing (or surfing) this weekend:

<strong>SciVerse</strong>, the Elsevier publishing platform that includes Science Direct ejournals and ebooks as well as the Scopus search engine, will be undergoing upgrades this weekend and will be <strong>unavailable Saturday, 2/26, from 8am to 8pm</strong>, or nearly all day.

In addition, <strong>WorldCat Local</strong>, which allows you to search the catalogs of most United States and some international libraries, will be <strong>unavailable Sunday, 2/27 from 1am to 6am</strong>.Â  That's basically late late overnight Saturday night.

We apologize for the inconvenience, and we hope that the enforced hiatus from these two services offers you the opportunity for some rest and relaxation as we head into Spring Break!
