This month and all months, we honor the African diaspora and the many contributions of African-Americans. The Northeastern University community is fortunate to have two related experts to help us to learn more about African American history. [Kantigi Camara](http://www.northeastern.edu/aai/library.html) is the Librarian who runs the [John D. O'Bryant African-American Institute Library](http://www.northeastern.edu/aai/library2.html). And Research & Instruction Librarian Christine Oka designed this [research guide](http://subjectguides.lib.neu.edu/africanamerican). She also provides reference assistance and manages a related collection at Snell Library. Additionally, here is a gorgeous [website](http://www.africanamericanhistorymonth.gov/) celebrating Black History Month, which was put together by the Library of Congress.
