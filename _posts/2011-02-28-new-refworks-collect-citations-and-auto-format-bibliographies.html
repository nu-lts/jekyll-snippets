Now you can automatically create bibliographies in three simple steps!  After creating an account on the RefWorks website, collect all your research citations in one place, and then use the RefWorks program to automatically create citations and format bibliographies in your papers.

You can access your RefWorks account from any computer connected to the internet, and you can even keep your RefWorks account as an alumnus.

<strong>(1)</strong> Start by making an account on the <a href="http://0-www.refworks.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/refworks" target="_blank">RefWorks website</a>.

<strong>(2)</strong> Next, as you do research, use library database features or the <a href="http://www.refworks.com/rwsingle/help/Using_RefGrab-It_to_Capture_Web_Page_Data.htm" target="_blank">RefWorks browser plugin</a> to automatically send citations to your RefWorks account.

<strong>(3)</strong> Finally, use the <a href="http://www.refworks.com/refworks/wncdownload.asp" target="_blank">RefWorks Microsoft Word plugin</a> to create citations and bibliographies for your paper.  (Mac Pages users can use a slightly different process <a href="http://refworks.scholarsportal.info/Refworks/help/Using_One_Line_Cite_View.htm" target="_blank">outlined here</a>.)

To learn more about using the program, see the RefWorks company’s series of tutorials <a href="http://www.refworks-cos.com/refworks/tutorials/basic.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

And don’t forget, Northeastern University also provides a subscription to <a href="../../online_research/help/citations_footnotes/endnote/" target="_blank">EndNote</a>.

<strong>Which one should I use?</strong> In general, RefWorks is better for undergraduates and researchers needing to share references, while EndNote has a higher learning curve but more features and is better for graduate students, faculty, and staff involved in deep research projects. For more information, see <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/help/citations_footnotes/web_comparison/" target="_blank">our in-depth comparison chart</a>.
