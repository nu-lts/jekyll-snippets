The Northeastern University Libraries are pleased to announce a new institutional membership in BioMedCentral, effective March 1, 2011. Northeastern joins over 350 institutions worldwide who support BioMedCentral, an online publisher with a pioneering policy of providing free and open access to the peer-reviewed research papers they publish. All research articles published in BioMedCentral's 213 biomedical and clinical journals are freely and universally accessible online with no barriers to access. And authors keep the copyright to their articles, allowing them to freely reuse and redistribute their research in print and online.

Northeastern's institutional membership helps sustain this publishing model through direct support of BioMedCentral as well as providing to its affiliated authors a 15% discount on the article processing fee paid upon acceptance of their submitted articles.

As well as securing Open Access to research, publishing in BioMedCentral's journals brings many additional benefits, including:

•	Immediate publication upon acceptance
•	No extra charge for extensive datasets, comprehensive methods, color figures, and video footage
•	The ability to track how many people have viewed a paper on BioMedCentral's website
•	A large number of journals to choose from, covering all subjects in biology and medicine with different levels of selectivity
