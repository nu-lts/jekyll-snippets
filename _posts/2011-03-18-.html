For those of you who missed it, Deborah Davidson's residency here at Northeastern was truly inspirational, and definitely educational. From simply mingling with her over breakfast to learning how to physically create a book with her by hand, she enlightened many of us with her passion and knowledge. Some of you might wonder, what's so special about a book? Well, in the words of Deborah herself, "There is something profound about the object of a book, which has remained unchanged for centuries. The book as a container of ideas, narrative, images and text is ever compelling for artists, designers and writers - for those who critique and understand culture."

And where better to mimic the ancient art of hand binding a book than in our very own Snell Library? If you didn't already know, Snell houses numerous ancient resources, like  illuminated manuscripts from as early as 1564.  

So for all your literature needs, be them making a paper book in the lobby of snell to give to your mother for mothers day (it's May 8th everyone!) to writing your art history paper and getting to study an actual hand painted scroll, you can be sure to stop by Snell. Oh, and to find out what the oldest book the library has, you can always do what I did, and just text the librarians!
