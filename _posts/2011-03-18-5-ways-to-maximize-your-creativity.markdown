Last week, creativity and brain expert [Dr. Shelley Carson](http://www.shelleycarson.com/your-creative-brain) visited Snell Library. She shared these five tips for maximizing your creativity.

1. Continue to actively learn and gather information throughout your life.

2. Turn off the automatic 'censor' in your brain (e.g. "that won't work because...").

3. Carry around a notepad or recorder-- breakthroughs often happen in the strangest of places, when your censors are turned down.

4. Read about and hang out with other creative people

5. Don't be afraid of failure. Creative people fail.

[Dr. Carson's book](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/record=b2423317~S19), _Your Creative Brain_, is available for checkout at Snell Library. Thank you, Dr. Carson, for encouraging us all to be engaged explorers of the Universe.
