Laptop locks are now available for use on ten of the group study tables outside of the InfoCommons on the first floor of Snell Library. Hooks are located on the corner edge of each table and locks can be signed out at the Circulation Desk for up to three hours (one renewal allowed per usage). For more information please contact the Circulation Desk on the 1st floor of Snell Library at 617.373.8778.
