On March 29, 2005, after Â a yearlong negotiation, the Walt Disney Company ended its relationship with Harvey and Bob Weinstein of Miramax Films.

Miramax was founded by the Weinstein brothers in 1979, and was soon established as an up and coming distributor and producer through movies such as _Pelle the Conqueror _(1989), _sex, lies and videotape _(1989), and _The Crying Game _(1992).

In 1993, the Weinsteins sold Miramax to Disney for $80 million in order to gain greater financial stability. It seemed to be an odd pairing due to Miramax's history with edgy, adult-oriented content and Disney's family-friendly reputation. However, it began well with the $108 million grossing Quentin Tarantino's _Pulp Fiction _(1994).

Movies like _Good Will Hunting _and_ Shakespeare in Love_ followed as Disney and Miramax continued to work together. However, discord began to brew after a few unsuccessful films and when the _Talk_ magazine project tanked the _New York Times _published an article announcing the split between the two companies.

According to the _NYT_ article, the split was decided when Disney refused to distribute Michael Moore's politically charged _Fahrenheit 9/11_, financed by Miramax. The controversy developed in the middle of contract negotiations, which ended with Disney as the retainer of the Miramax name and the Weinstein's with Dimension Films, which produced hits such as _Scream_ and _Scary Movie _as well as $130 million to start a new film production company.
