When we walk around the Snell Library we see a busy building full of so many people coming to do so many different things. 

There are students heading briskly to the Infocommons or searching for a quiet place to study,  faculty looking for a seminar talk, staff researchers finding and copying journal articles, high school students and their parents taking tours.  In the cafe, groups ensconce themselves at booths, laptops open, chip bags and coffee cups accumulating on the table.  It's a lived-in place, Club Snell.

But there are also many users who are invisible to the naked eye. Online, they renew their books, request materials from other libraries, log in to search a database, download a .pdf, compare corporate price-earnings ratios, or reserve a group study room.

Paradoxically, even though we can't "see" these users with the naked eye, we can see them statistically, and we are so pleased to learn that thousands of you who may not be in the building are still in the library virtually, perhaps connecting from down the street, and perhaps from the other side of the globe. 

The other day (March 15, to be exact), we took a snapshot of our online users, and here's what we found:

Most online users that day were undergraduate students, in fact, undergraduates made up more than all of the other online groups combined! 

Let's take a closer look at who connected to the library among NU undergraduates:

Students from the College of Social Sciences and Humanities were the largest group of online library users on that day, followed by students of the Bouve College.  Closely tied with them at third place were students from the College of Business Administration.

Comparing these numbers with the actual size of the college gives us a clearer picture of who is using our services.

The College of Social Science undergraduates are strongly overrepresented as library users.  They are 16 percent of the total undergraduate student body at NU, and 25% of library users. 

 The College of Science is also overrepresented at 16% of library users, 14% of the NU undergraduate student body.  Similarly Bouve college is overrepresented, at 13% of library users and 11% of the undergraduate student body.  

Other colleges were close but slightly underrepresented:
College of Computer Science: 2% of library users, 3% of undergraduates
CBA: 16% of library users, 17% of undergraduates

Finally, some colleges are significantly underrepresented as library users.
CPS undergraduates are 15% of the total, but only 8% of library users
Engineering students are 13% of the total but only 7% of library users
