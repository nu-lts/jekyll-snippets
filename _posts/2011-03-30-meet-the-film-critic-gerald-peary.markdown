Sadly, tomorrow marks our last Meet the Author talk of the Spring Semester, but we are thrilled to be hosting such a fantastic event. [Tomorrow's talk](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/index.php#peary) will feature [Gerald Peary](http://geraldpeary.com/), a well known film critic, and screen his documentary, [_For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1241707/)_._ Peary, who currently heads the film department at Suffolk University, will discuss his studies and knowledge of the American movie reviewing profession. Popcorn and refreshments will be served!

We hope to see you all for our final event tomorrow at 3pm in 90 Snell Library, and stay tuned for future events coming in the Fall Semester!
