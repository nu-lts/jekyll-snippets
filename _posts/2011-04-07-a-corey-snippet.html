As to hopefully one day become a Marine Corps Officer Candidate, I am fascinated by the events detailed in my current read, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Generation-Kill-Captain-America-American/dp/0399151931"><em>Generation Kill</em></a> by Evan Wright. During the invasion of Baghdad in 2003, Wright describes the turmoil and hardships experienced by the Marine Corps’ prestigious 1<sup>st</sup> Reconnaissance Battalion.  Riding along with First Recon Marines led by Nathaniel Fick, a second lieutenant at the time, Wright depicts every aspect of the life of a Marine at war. There is also a HBO mini-series called <a href="<a href="http://www.hbo.com/generation-kill/index.html">Generation Kill</a> which is based off the book.

If you would like to learn more about the invasion into Iraq I would recommend reading Nathaniel Fick’s autobiography titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/One-Bullet-Away-Making-Officer/dp/0618773436/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1302202911&sr=1-1"><em>One Bullet Away: The Making of a Marine Officer</em></a> or you can use the library search function to find out more on the topic by searching <a href="http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search/X?SEARCH=iraq+invasion&amp;searchscope=19&amp;submit=Search">"iraq invasion"</a> for example.
