As to hopefully one day become a Marine Corps Officer Candidate, I am fascinated by the events detailed in my current read, [_Generation Kill_](http://www.amazon.com/Generation-Kill-Captain-America-American/dp/0399151931) by Evan Wright. During the invasion of Baghdad in 2003, Wright describes the turmoil and hardships experienced by the Marine Corps’ prestigious 1st Reconnaissance Battalion.  Riding along with First Recon Marines led by Nathaniel Fick, a second lieutenant at the time, Wright depicts every aspect of the life of a Marine at war. There is also a HBO mini-series called [Generation Kill](<a href=) which is based off the book.

If you would like to learn more about the invasion into Iraq I would recommend reading Nathaniel Fick’s autobiography titled [_One Bullet Away: The Making of a Marine Officer_](http://www.amazon.com/One-Bullet-Away-Making-Officer/dp/0618773436/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1302202911&sr=1-1) or you can use the library search function to find out more on the topic by searching ["iraq invasion"](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search/X?SEARCH=iraq+invasion&searchscope=19&submit=Search) for example.
