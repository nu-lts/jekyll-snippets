Congratulations to two Snell Library staff: Maria Carpenter, Director of Advancement & Marketing, and Hillary Corbett, Scholarly Communication Librarian, who presented their research at yesterday's [Research & Scholarship Expo.](http://www.northeastern.edu/expo/)

Maria presented her work, ["Cheerleader, Opportunity Seeker, and Master Strategist: ARL Directors as Entrepreneurial Leaders,"](http://www.northeastern.edu/expo/view_abstracts/abstract.php?sid=1933) which examines how entrepreneurial leadership can be used to generate income, build new partnerships, and improve services. This study examines how library directors who are members of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) define and engage in entrepreneurial leadership and suggests how entrepreneurial leadership can improve finances, foster innovation, and build prestige.

Hillary presented the library'sÂ vision for its researcher support services in her work titled, ["Digital Solutions and Services to Support Research at the Northeastern University Libraries."](http://www.northeastern.edu/expo/view_abstracts/abstract.php?sid=1820) It describes Northeastern Libraries' early project implementations and explores opportunities for future development and collaboration of its suite of researcher support services. The full suite of services discussed includes [IRis](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/) (Northeastern's Digital Archives), Digital Repository Service, and Data Curation Services.
