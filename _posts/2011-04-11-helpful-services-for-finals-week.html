Snell Library will be offering additional services during finals week to help you get the most out of your cram session before that big exam.

The first is adding extended hours of public safety escort van services. Starting at 9:30pm on Tuesday, April 19th, personal safety escort van services will run from the Library Quad to student residence halls. The service will run every half hour from 9:30pm until 3:30am each night through Thursday, April 29th at 3:30am. For more information about public safety at Northeastern visit <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/publicsafety/">http://www.northeastern.edu/publicsafety/</a>

In addition to the escort services, the Cyber Cafe will have extended hours to provide fresh food and snacks throughout finals week. The new hours of operation will be:

Thursday, April 21st: 7am-12am
Friday, April 22nd: 7am-5pm
Monday, April 25th to Thursday, April 28th: 7am-12am

And of course we also have so many resources here at Snell Library to help you wrap up that final research paper or close out that group project. Read through my previous post <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=3288">"March Madness at Snell"</a> for more helpful tips!

Good luck with your last exams of the Spring Semester! Hope to see you around <a href="http://twitter.com/ClubSnell">Club Snell!</a>
