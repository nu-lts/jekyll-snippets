With finals week fast approaching and students all over campus getting ready for the end of the semester, art and design students are bound to start camping out in Ryder to work in the computer labs for their final projects. It can get pretty crowded, and difficult to work around class time blocks in the labs- so what do you do?

Snell conveniently offers a full room of state of the art computers equipped with all of the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/dmdsiguide/" target="_blank">software</a> you find on the computers in Ryder. The BIG difference is that this lab, the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/digital_media/digital_media_services/" target="_blank">Digital Media Design Studio</a> on the second floor of Snell Library, comes with knowledgable staff who are there to help you with your projects and assist you with your design questions. You can also reserve a computer station by calling the studio at 617.373.2465 to ensure you have a space in the studio. Stop by and check it out!
