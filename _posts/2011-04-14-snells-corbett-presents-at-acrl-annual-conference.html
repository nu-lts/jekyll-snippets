Snell Library's Scholarly Communication Librarian, Hillary Corbett, presented a poster at the Annual Conference of the <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/events/national/2011/program/" target="_blank">Association of College and Research Libraries</a> in Philadelphia at the end of March.

Hillary's presentation demonstrated how the power of Google Analytics helps her to market an important library service:<a href="http://iris.lib.neu.edu" target="_blank"> IRis, our institutional repository</a>.  She has used Google Analytics to study how the research created at Northeastern is used and cited by writers and scholars around the globe.  This helps make a persuasive case for all you Northeastern researchers to archive your work in IRis!

<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2047/d20000327" target="_blank">The poster is available here in IRis</a>, along with thousands of other papers, presentations, and documents by Northeastern researchers.

Ten other librarians from Snell also attended the conference, including Dean Will Wakeling, pictured above with Hillary Corbett in the exhibit hall at the Philadelphia Convention Center.
