Last Friday, April 8th the New England Technical Services Librarians group held its Spring Conference in Worcester, MA. Snell Library's own Janet Morrow was honored with the NETSL Award for Excellence in Technical Services, and for her 28 years of service, accomplishments, and important contributions to the profession.

Congratulations Janet for a well deserved honor!
