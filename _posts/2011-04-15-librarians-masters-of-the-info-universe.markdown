In honor of National Library Week we'd like to share some fun facts

**Famous Librarians**

J. Edgar Hoover, Casanova, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, former first lady Laura Bush, and Mao Zedong have all at one point worked as a librarian or in a library.

**Librarians influence our culture and society**

While clearing out old archives at the Palmer Theological Seminary in 2005, librarian Heather Carbo found a working manuscript of one of Beethoven's final compositions

**Librarians are heroic**

Alia Muhammad Baker, the chief librarian of Basra, Iraq, removed 30,000 books from the city's main library before it was destroyed during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

**Their numbers are many**

In 2009, there were 206,000 librarians, 50,000 library technicians and 96,000 other education, training and library workers

**Warning to readers about librarians**

A character in "The Callahan Touch", one of science fiction writer Spider Robinson's books, said, "Librarians are the secret masters of the universe. They control information. Never piss one off."

Happy National Library Week!
