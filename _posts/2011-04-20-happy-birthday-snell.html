The <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/20th/">20th anniversary celebration</a> of Snell Library is fast approaching, and we couldn't be more excited!

We hope that you will join us on April 25th at 2pm as we gather to celebrate and learn about the outstanding impact Snell Library has made in our community and our vision for its future. We will start our celebration with a talk from Dean of Libraries, Will Wakeling, who will then be followed by our featured speaker <a href="http://blogs.archives.gov/aotus/">David S. Ferriero</a>, the 10th Archivist of the United States. Following the speakers, a VIP reception will be held on the second floor for our RSVP'd guests. Meanwhile, students can take a study break and enjoy  cake served in the Cyber Cafe and also de-stress with soft tissue mobilization sessions (massages) offered in the library lobby. These techniques are provided by the Physical Therapy Club who are trained experts!

To attend the afternoon's events please RSVP to Nina Shah at <a href="mailto:nin.shah@neu.edu">nin.shah@neu.edu</a>. We hope to see you there!
