<a href="http://ted.com" target="_blank">TED</a>, which stands for Technology, Entertainment, Design and is known for their fantastic talks by remarkable people, has announced its plans to audition speakers for the chance to have their own TED talk. On May 24th, TED will hold its first ever public audition for TED Talks in New York in front of a live audience.

All you have to do is submit a one-minute video by <strong>April 25 at 11:59 p.m</strong>. indicating your idea and how you would present it. Some of the topic suggestions include  "a talk given in front of a custom-animated movie",  "intense campfire-style storytelling", and  "a rant delivered at blitzkrieg pace."  Of course, other ideas are welcome.

Once you upload your video to <a href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> or <a href="http://vimeo.com" target="_blank">Vimeo</a>, complete the <a href="https://spreadsheets2.google.com/viewform?formkey=dE9qUDdXTHUxOXlHYldHZmwxTnpnZlE6MQ&amp;ndplr=1" target="_blank">online submission form</a> and see if you're a winner.
