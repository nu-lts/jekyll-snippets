For all you students trying to hunker down and study in Snell today, you might be slightly thrown off if you can't find your usual study spot or table on the second floor. Never fear! In preparation for the Snell Library 20th Anniversary Celebration, some of the tables and chairs that usually live on the second floor have been temporarily relocated to the back of the first floor.

If you're having trouble locating a space, please feel free to ask a librarian or staff member for assistance, and don't forget to stop by and celebrate with us! The festivities begin at 2pm in the lobby on the first floor.
