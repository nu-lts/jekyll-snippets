On April 28th <a <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/">RateMyProfessor.com</a> released a list of their top 25 picks for best universities across the country. The decision was based on the ratings and comments of students regarding campus professors, environment, and facilities. We are proud to announce that Northeastern University received 11th place and we are even more proud to know that Snell Library helped us reach this ranking. Quality of professors made up 50% of the score while the other 50% was based off of school reputation, location, career opportunities, library, food services, and social activities.

Here's to summer at one of the 25 best universities in the country!
