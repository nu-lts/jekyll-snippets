As part of our celebration of our 20th year, we are highlighting some of the key features, services and collections of Snell Library. One of these features, which we sometimes take for granted, is the collection of paintings that grace our walls. If you stop by 421 in Snell Library and walk around the halls on the fourth floor, you will see a collection of paintings that came from Northeastern alumnus, Arthur S. Goldberg, MEd '65, a Boston-area businessman who has been an avid collector for more than 30 years.  Now you can enjoy his collection anywhere, anytime, by viewing an online exhibit, designed by Steven Olimpio, a former graphic design co-op student at the library:  <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/goldberg">The Arthur S. Goldberg Collection at Northeastern</a>.
