On behalf of Snell Library, I would like to congratulate all the graduates. We have seen how hard you’ve all worked. You have filled up every table and corner of the library, from the Cyber Café to the 4th floor quiet areas. We feel that your success is ours and that makes us, well, a little bit proud!

Anyone graduating today who was a student worker at Snell Library? We want to congratulate you and thank you for your service to the library. Contact us, and we can give you a Snell Library t-shirt!

I heard a great speech by Sarah Tishler at the Psychology Department graduation ceremony yesterday. I continue to be impressed by the achievements of our students, and by the number of undergraduates who are doing research alongside faculty. 

Graduation is a time of celebration, but it can also feel like a time of ending and loss. We want you to remember that Club Snell can always be your home-away-from-home! You are soon to become alumni. We have services for alumni, listed here: [http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/for_alumni/](http://www.lib.neu.edu/services/for_alumni/).  As an alum, for example, you are entitled to reserve the Anna & Eugene M. Reppucci Alumni Reading Room, and you can still borrow books from Snell. To keep in touch, please follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/clubsnell) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Northeastern-University-Libraries/71520567525).

What a beautiful day for Commencement 2011! Congratulations to all the grads!
