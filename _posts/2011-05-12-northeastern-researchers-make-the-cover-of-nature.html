Our very own Northeastern researchers have offered a new look towards "merging the tools of network science and control theory" to better control complex systems. Their findings were featured on the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v473/n7346/index.html" target="_blank">cover of the May 12th issue of the journal <em>Nature</em></a>.

<a href="http://works.bepress.com/abarabasi/" target="_blank">Albert-L&aacute;szl&oacute; Barab&aacute;si</a>, a professor in the Departments of Physics and Biology and in the College of Computer and Information Science, and <a href="http://www.physics.neu.edu/associates.html" target="_blank">Yang-Yu Liu</a>, a postdoctoral research associate in Physics, coauthored the paper, along with an MIT colleague.

Their focus was to merge control theory with network science research in order to create more efficient methods of gaining control of a complex system, such as cellular networks or social media, by identifying the driving nodes of the system. Read more about their research in <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/news/stories/2011/05/nature_paper.html" target="_blank">this news@Northeastern press release</a>. You can also find more of Professor Barab&aacute;si's research publications in <a href="http://iris.lib.neu.edu/" target="_blank">IRis, Northeastern's institutional repository</a>.

Congrats to our NU researchers for this inspiring breakthrough!
