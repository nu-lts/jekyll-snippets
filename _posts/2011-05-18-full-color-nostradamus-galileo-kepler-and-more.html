Google Books, in partnership with many of the great libraries in Europe, has just released <strong>full-color</strong> scans of important texts from the 16th and 17th centuries. They include <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=v62N12IIlDMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=thumbnail&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Nostradamus' prophecies</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KUE1AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=thumbnail&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Kepler's textbook on astronomy</a>, and several works by Galileo including his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=l5qu7Aj34d4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=thumbnail&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Systema cosmicum</a>, arguing that the Earth revolves around the Sun.

The full-color scans are particularly important for <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=l5qu7Aj34d4C&amp;pg=PP5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">illustrations</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=K2U_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">diagrams</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=e_xb36M88H8C&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">maps</a>, and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ON47yt31VvAC&amp;pg=PP3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">distinguishing handwriting</a>. Some of the books ages' lead to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ON47yt31VvAC&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">bleedthrough</a> (where the type on the other side of the page is visible), but even in those cases the full-color images give a sense of how the physical material has changed over time.

There is not a separate interface through which you can access these books, but using the date limiters in the <a href="http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search" target="_blank">Google Books Advanced Search</a> will help you find them. More detail is available at the <a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2011/05/books-from-16th-and-17th-centuries-now.html" target="_blank">Inside Google Books blog post</a>.
