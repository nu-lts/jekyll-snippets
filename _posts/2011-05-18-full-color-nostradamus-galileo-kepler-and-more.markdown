Google Books, in partnership with many of the great libraries in Europe, has just released **full-color** scans of important texts from the 16th and 17th centuries. They include [Nostradamus' prophecies](http://books.google.com/books?id=v62N12IIlDMC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=thumbnail&q&f=false), [Kepler's textbook on astronomy](http://books.google.com/books?id=KUE1AAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=thumbnail&q&f=false), and several works by Galileo including his [Systema cosmicum](http://books.google.com/books?id=l5qu7Aj34d4C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=thumbnail&q&f=false), arguing that the Earth revolves around the Sun.

The full-color scans are particularly important for [illustrations](http://books.google.com/books?id=l5qu7Aj34d4C&pg=PP5#v=onepage&q&f=false), [diagrams](http://books.google.com/books?id=K2U_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false), [maps](http://books.google.com/books?id=e_xb36M88H8C&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q&f=false), and [distinguishing handwriting](http://books.google.com/books?id=ON47yt31VvAC&pg=PP3#v=onepage&q&f=false). Some of the books ages' lead to [bleedthrough](http://books.google.com/books?id=ON47yt31VvAC&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false) (where the type on the other side of the page is visible), but even in those cases the full-color images give a sense of how the physical material has changed over time.

There is not a separate interface through which you can access these books, but using the date limiters in the [Google Books Advanced Search](http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search) will help you find them. More detail is available at the [Inside Google Books blog post](http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2011/05/books-from-16th-and-17th-centuries-now.html).
