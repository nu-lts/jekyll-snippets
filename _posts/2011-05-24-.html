Snell Library is updating it's copy and scanning technology to provide more convenient and environmentally conscious services.

Â Free scanning stations will replace the old copier machines on each floor beginning on June 30th. This installment will create a greener study environment, and allow students to take advantage of the library services free of charge. Students are encouraged to save their scanned documents onto flash drives to eliminate unnecessary printing.

Conway cards will no longer be vaild after June 30th, so please be sure to use up your funds before then!
