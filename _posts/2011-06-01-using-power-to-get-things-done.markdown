Snell Library's own Maria Carpenter recently presented at the [2011 Academic Library Advancement and Development Network AnnualÂ Conference in Flagstaff, Arizona](http://library.nau.edu/aladn2011/). Maria, the Director of Advancement, Marketing, and Communications for [Northeastern University Libraries](http://www.lib.neu.edu), gave a presentation and a workshop on power theory and its use in different political and social organizations.

Her sessions focused on examples of how leaders of organizations have successfully used power and how those examples can be applied to those in the library advancement field. Her presentation took place during a lunch session on May 17th where over 100 people were in attendance. The workshop that followed allowed attendees to take part in a more interactive q&a; discussion about power and how to use it in the workplace.
