If you have ever joined a book club you know from experience that it is not easy to coordinate busy schedules, agree on next month's book, or decide who will be next to host. Northeastern Journalism Professor, Jeffrey Howe, has created a book club that eliminates all of these troubles. Howe's book club is on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) [@1book140](http://twitter.com/#!/1book140). The way it works is quite simple. 1book140 selects the book of the month by a majority vote of its Twitter followers. Once a book is selected members tweet their thoughts as they read, abiding by the month's weekly schedule, and including the hashtag #1book140 so that their comments are collected on the site's Twitter page.

This month, readers have their noses in [_The Blind Assassin_](http://www.amazon.com/Blind-Assassin-Novel-Margaret-Atwood/dp/0385720955) by [Margaret Atwood](http://www.margaretatwood.ca/). If you're interested in joining you can view the [weekly reading schedule for June](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/05/the-1book140-june-reading-schedule/239632/) and reserve  [_The Blind Assassin_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/search~S19?/aatwood%2C+margaret/aatwood+margaret/1%2C2%2C63%2CE/frameset&FF=aatwood+margaret+1939&2%2C4%2C) at Snell Library to start your summer reading!
