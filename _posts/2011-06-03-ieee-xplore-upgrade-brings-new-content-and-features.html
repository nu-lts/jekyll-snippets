On Wednesday, IEEE upgraded the <a title="IEEE Xplore digital library" href="http://0-www.ieee.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/ieeexplore/" target="_blank">IEEE <em>Xplore </em>Digital Library</a>.

Here are some of the new features:

<strong>1. Addition of VDE VERLAG Conference Proceedings:</strong> One of the largest technical and scientific associations in Europe, VDE VERLAG now integrates its conference proceedings into IEEE <em>Xplore</em> bringing new and important content that was not available to us before.

There are 3,100 VDE conference papers from 20+ annual conference titles and 1,000 new articles anticipated to be added every year.

<strong>2. Sort search results by "Most Cited":</strong> This new feature allows you to sort your search results by "Most Cited" and a citation count will be displayed on each article so you will be able to find articles of high impact quickly.

<strong>3. See more search results with scitopia.org:</strong> <a title="Scitopia.org" href="http://cl.exct.net/?ju=fe2a157274670074701177&amp;ls=fdf21372766105797d127874&amp;m=fefa1174706601&amp;l=fe9a167477640d7f77&amp;s=fe1413757d6100747c1276&amp;jb=ffcf14&amp;t=">Scitopia.org</a> is a search engine that surfaces content from 15 leading scholarly society publishers in science and technology. Now, when you perform your search in IEEE <em>Xplore</em> you will see additional relevant results from scitopia.org.

Enjoy the new IEEEXplore upgrade, and we hope it makes your research easier!
