On Wednesday, IEEE upgraded the [IEEE _Xplore _Digital Library](http://0-www.ieee.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/ieeexplore/).

Here are some of the new features:

**1. Addition of VDE VERLAG Conference Proceedings:** One of the largest technical and scientific associations in Europe, VDE VERLAG now integrates its conference proceedings into IEEE _Xplore_ bringing new and important content that was not available to us before.

There are 3,100 VDE conference papers from 20+ annual conference titles and 1,000 new articles anticipated to be added every year.

**2. Sort search results by "Most Cited":** This new feature allows you to sort your search results by "Most Cited" and a citation count will be displayed on each article so you will be able to find articles of high impact quickly.

**3. See more search results with scitopia.org:** [Scitopia.org](http://cl.exct.net/?ju=fe2a157274670074701177&ls=fdf21372766105797d127874&m=fefa1174706601&l=fe9a167477640d7f77&s=fe1413757d6100747c1276&jb=ffcf14&t=) is a search engine that surfaces content from 15 leading scholarly society publishers in science and technology. Now, when you perform your search in IEEE _Xplore_ you will see additional relevant results from scitopia.org.

Enjoy the new IEEEXplore upgrade, and we hope it makes your research easier!
