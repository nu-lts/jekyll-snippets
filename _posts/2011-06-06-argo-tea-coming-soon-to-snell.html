We are excited to announce that <a href="http://www.argotea.com/" target="_blank">Argo Tea</a> will be replacing the Cyber Cafe on the first floor of Snell Library this Fall! As <a href="http://www.nudining.com/news/2011/5/coming-soonsubway-and-argo-tea" target="_blank">Dining Services has announced</a>, construction will begin this month to ensure it is ready for the first day of classes in September.

For those of you who haven't heard of Argo Tea, the business originated in Chicago in 2003, and was created by Arsen Avakian, Daniel Lindwasser, and Simon Simonian. Their cafes offer a variety of black, white, green, and natural herbal teas, coffees, and an assortment of baked goods and small entrees.

In addition to their healthy menu options, Argo Tea has made continuous donations of white teas to the University of Chicago's Hospitals to contribute to Cancer Research efforts.
