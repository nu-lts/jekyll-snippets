We at Snell would like to wish our fellow staff members good luck as they head to the 2011 American Library Association Annual Conference in New Orleans this week. The conference will begin today and be held through June 28th and is one of the largest events for the library community. More than 25,000 librarians, educators, authors, publishers, literacy experts, illustrators and the leading suppliers to the market attend to discuss ways to improve the libraries.

Maria Carpenter, Director of Advancement and Marketing at NU Libraries, will present on a <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/advocacy/frontlinefundraising/index.cfm">fundraising toolkit</a> for librarians she co-developed to help library staff and supporters understand how annual funds, special gifts (such as memorials and tributes), major gifts, and planned giving work. Maria is also an author of <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/standards/diversity_draft.pdf">Diversity Standards: Cultural Competency for Academic Libraries</a>, a standards and guidelines document for the <a href="http://www.acrl.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/index.cfm">Association of College &amp; Research Libraries</a> which will be introduced at the conference.

Also from Snell Library, Amanda Rust and Annie DeVane will present a poster on their recent research for the Library's new Drupal-based website. The aim of the survey was to determine what sort of staffing would be necessary for a large, heavily-customized Drupal Web site, and the results, therefore, give a brief overview of the current citizens of the Drupal library community. Karen Merguerian and Diann Smothers were also co-authors on this poster.  You can view the poster and full survey results here:  <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/ALADrupalPoster2011/">http://www.lib.neu.edu/ALADrupalPoster2011/</a>
