While my work weeks tend to be unbearably busy at best, I always find myself looking for something fun (and reasonably cheap!) to do on the lazy Sunday afternoons I face each week. This weekend my roommates dragged me over to Faneuil Hall to explore and see what was going on. Interestingly, a man dressed as a pirate stopped us and invited us on a guided historic of ocean front of Boston.

This made me start to wonder about the legitimacy of the tour, because honestly, Boston is not a pirate town. But, for the low low price of $13 a person (part of the proceeds go to the upkeep of Quincy Market and Faneuil Marketplace) we jumped aboard the walking tour and took off on our adventure.

Our pirate guide, who goes by the name of Nathaniel Ellis, was witty and in near perfect character for the entire tour (up until a group of segways interrupted his speech). I found myself intrigued and inspired to learn more about our Boston culture, and to immerse myself in more of its history.

That being said, I came to Snell this morning to begin my research.
