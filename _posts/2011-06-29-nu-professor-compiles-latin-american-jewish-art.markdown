Northeastern Spanish and Latin American literature professorÂ [Stephen Sadow](http://www.modernlanguages.neu.edu/Layer2/Stephen.htm) worked with his Argentinian colleagues to create a collection of fourteen "artist's books" that feature poems and artwork of the Jewish communities in Latin America.

Sadow selected 14 poems, and then assigned each one to a Jewish artist from Latin America. The artists were asked to create a unique piece of artwork to match their interpretation of the poem they were assigned. The poems focus on a range of themes: Jewish identity, mysticism, Old Testament themes, the Holocaust, and the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community in Argentina, among others.

In addition to this poetry compilation, Sadow also recently completed an "open source" anthology that features the work of 13 Latin American Jewish poets from the 1960s to the present. This anthology, and many of his other works, can be found in [IRis, Northeastern University Libraries' digital archive](http://works.bepress.com/ssadow/)!

For more information read the recent [NU News article](http://www.northeastern.edu/news/stories/2011/06/sadow.html) on Professor Sadow's work.
