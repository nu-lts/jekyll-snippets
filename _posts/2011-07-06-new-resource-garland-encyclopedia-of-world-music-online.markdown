NU Libraries is proud to announce our subscription to Alexander Street Press's [_The Garland Encyclopedia of Music Online_](http://0-glnd.alexanderstreet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/) which is now available to the NU Community on or off campus.

This comprehensive resource on the study of world music provides access to scholarly content, includes images, and a nine-volume CD collection. Search and browse through a range of genres and indexes, utilize playlists, and create your own playlists.

Go to this link to learn more [http://0-glnd.alexanderstreet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/](http://0-glnd.alexanderstreet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/). For best performance Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 or Firefox 3.5 or higher are recommended.

Snell Library has also retained the [print version of the _Encyclopedia_](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b1456714~S19), which is housed in the Reference collection on the second floor of the library.
