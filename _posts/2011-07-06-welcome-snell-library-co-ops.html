This week four Northeastern co-ops have started working at Snell Library to assist in various departments through the summer and fall semesters. Here is a little bit about each of them:

"My name is Kelsey Strout and I am a middler in the Art and Design program at Northeastern. I traded a small town in New Jersey for the big and beautiful city of Boston. I have had a passion for art my entire life and feel most comfortable when partaking in creative activities. I am working toward a BA in Art and Design and a minor in Business Administration with the hopes of becoming an event designer after graduating. In my spare time, I enjoy drawing, babysitting, going to the beach and baking."

"I'm a fourth year Graphic Design major going for a minor in Sociology. Outside of my studies, I enjoy the fine arts and love to draw and sculpt. I've recently ventured into the realm of tattooing and frequently transform my living room into a makeshift tattoo parlor."

<strong>William Bratches, University Archives Co-op</strong>

“My name is William Bratches, and I am a middler majoring in history with two minors in business and political science.
