**Kelsey Strout, Marketing & Events Co-op**

"My name is Kelsey Strout and I am a middler in the Art and Design program at Northeastern. I traded a small town in New Jersey for the big and beautiful city of Boston. I have had a passion for art my entire life and feel most comfortable when partaking in creative activities. I am working toward a BA in Art and Design and a minor in Business Administration with the hopes of becoming an event designer after graduating. In my spare time, I enjoy drawing, babysitting, going to the beach and baking."

**Will Macowski, Graphic Design Co-op**

"I'm a fourth year Graphic Design major going for a minor in Sociology. Outside of my studies, I enjoy the fine arts and love to draw and sculpt. I've recently ventured into the realm of tattooing and frequently transform my living room into a makeshift tattoo parlor."

**William Bratches, University Archives Co-op**

“My name is William Bratches, and I am a middler majoring in history with two minors in business and political science. Although Boston is now home, I am originally from a small town on the Connecticut shoreline. Besides history, I enjoy music, running, reading, cooking, biking, and recently picked up tailoring!”

**Mike Helly, DMDS Co-op**

Co-op student Mike Helly is a graphic design major at Northeastern University. Web design and book layout are the areas of design that he finds most interesting. In his free time Mike enjoys to skateboard, play basketball, and listen to hip hop.

Welcome new co-ops and best of luck within each of your positions! We are so happy to have you :)
