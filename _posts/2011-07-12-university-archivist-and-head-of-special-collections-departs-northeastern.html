Joan Krizack, University Archivist and Head of Special Collections, will depart Northeastern University after 17 years since her arrival as the founding archivist.

Joan leaves a legacy at the University of several hundred historical collections that document the struggles and triumphs of Boston's African American, Chinese, Latino and GLBTQ communities. She has also received numerous awards; most recently the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/press_room/joan_krizack/">Champions of Freedom Award</a> for her work managing Northeastern University’s collection of the historical records of Boston's Freedom House and digitizing the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/freedomhouse">Freedom House photograph collection.</a>
