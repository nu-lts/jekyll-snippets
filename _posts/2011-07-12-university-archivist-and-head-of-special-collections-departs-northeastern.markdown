Joan Krizack, University Archivist and Head of Special Collections, will depart Northeastern University after 17 years since her arrival as the founding archivist. Joan resigned her position on July 7th to pursue a career as a freelance consultant. Joan leaves a legacy at the University of several hundred historical collections that document the struggles and triumphs of Boston's African American, Chinese, Latino and GLBTQ communities. She has also received numerous awards; most recently the [Champions of Freedom Award](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/press_room/joan_krizack/) for her work managing Northeastern University’s collection of the historical records of Boston's Freedom House and digitizing the [Freedom House photograph collection.](http://www.lib.neu.edu/freedomhouse)
