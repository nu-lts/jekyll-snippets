Tonight is the night Harry Potter fans have been waiting for, the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. If you haven't already purchased your tickets, you better do so quickly, as seats are selling out fast! Regal Fenway Stadium 13 has eleven theaters showing midnght premiers, and the AMC Lowes Theater in the Boston Commons has ten theaters showing the midnight premier, all of which have sold out.

"The final chapter begins as Harry, Ron, and Hermione continue their quest of finding and destroying the Dark Lord's three remaining Horcruxes, the magical items responsible for his immortality. But as the mystical Deathly Hallows are uncovered, and Voldemort finds out about their mission, the biggest battle begins and life as they know it will never be the same again." -The Internet Movie Database
