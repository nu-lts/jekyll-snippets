Construction is underway as Snell Library's CyberCafe gets transformed into Boston's first ArgoTea. ArgoTea offers a variety of specialty beverages derived from an assortment of global teas and coffee. There's one for everyone! From sweet and fruity to dark and bitter with a little bit of everything in between- you're sure to be satisfied!

As with any construction comes a little (or a lot!) of noise, so please excuse the additional auditory effects in the library as construction is completed.

ArgoTea is expected to open the first week of August! Get a head start and choose your favorite beverage by checking out the menu online: <a href="http://argotea.com/">http://argotea.com/</a>

Any questions or concerns about the construction of ArgoTea can be directed to Frank Mahoney, Director of Special Projects, at <a href="mailto:f.mahoney@neu.edu">f.mahoney@neu.edu</a>
