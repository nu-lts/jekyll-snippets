Construction is underway as Snell Library's CyberCafe gets transformed into Boston's first ArgoTea. ArgoTea offers a variety of specialty beverages derived from an assortment of global teas and coffee. There's one for everyone! From sweet and fruity to dark and bitter with a little bit of everything in between- you're sure to be satisfied!

As with any construction comes a little (or a lot!) of noise, so please excuse the additional auditory effects in the library as construction is completed.

ArgoTea is expected to open the first week of August! Get a head start and choose your favorite beverage by checking out the menu online: [http://argotea.com/](http://argotea.com/)

Any questions or concerns about the construction of ArgoTea can be directed to Frank Mahoney, Director of Special Projects, at [f.mahoney@neu.edu](mailto:f.mahoney@neu.edu)
