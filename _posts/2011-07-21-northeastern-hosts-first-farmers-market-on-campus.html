July 20, 2011 marked the (much anticipated) first ever farmer's market at Northeastern! Due to issues involving city permits, the event had to be postponed for many weeks; however, it was well worth the wait! Heaven's Harvest Farm, located in New Braintree, MA, is a certified organic farm, partnered with six other farms in the surrounding Massachusetts area.

Heaven's Harvest Farm provided fresh picked, organic products including Asian greens, lettuces, sweet potatoes, tomatos, eggplant, broccoli, spinach, sweet corn, berries, apples, herbs, pears and peaches (to name a few). They also had eggs and cheese!

The market was held in Centennial Circle, between Ryder Hall and Ruggles Station, from 12pm to 6pm and it was such a hit that much of the produce was gone by 4pm.

The Farmer's Market will be on campus every Wednesday until late fall, so if you missed out on this week, you still have plenty of other opportunities. I recommend getting there early so you don't miss out on their selection of produce!
