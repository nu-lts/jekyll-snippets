A quick photocopy-ing update: The old Conway-brand stand-alone photocopiers are gone!*  Now the new scanning stations can take center stage. Please let us know at the Circulation desk on the first floor if you need any help getting going, but the scanners are easy to use, and free!

*(On the third and fourth floor, there will still be one machine each that can accept ONLY your remaining "Conway Card" value through the fall term, but otherwise we're moving completely to the [paperless new scanners](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=3667).)
