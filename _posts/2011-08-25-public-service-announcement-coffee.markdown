Big news. Important news. The Starbucks in Curry is closing this afternoon and will stay closed through the day tomorrow. That's right, all day on Friday. (And our own local Argo Tea isn't open, officially, until Monday.)




We need other options, what's your backup? Peet's in IV, Dunkin' in Ryder? Espresso Royale (Gasp! all that way to Gainsborough St...)




What will we do?!
