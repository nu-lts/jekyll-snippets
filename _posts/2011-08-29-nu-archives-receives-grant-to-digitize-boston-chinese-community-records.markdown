The Northeastern University Libraries' Archives and Special Collections Department recently received a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) through the Library Services and Technology Act administered by the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners.

The award will go towards a project to digitize the entire Chinese Progressive Association collection comprising 12 cubic feet of historical material, including documents, posters, photographs, negatives, and audio and videotapes, dating from 1976-2006. Some of the images in the collection document rallies and protests, like the photo below, against the expansion of Tufts New England Medical Center in Chinatown. They also depict photos of celebrations in honor of Chinese holidays like Chinese New Year.
