Yes, it's that time of year! Welcome Week is upon us. The bulk of Welcome Week events begin next week on September 6th and the Library will be welcoming new students to Northeastern's campus as well as saying "hello again!" to students who are back to start another academic year. The first day of classes is September 7th, but all week Northeastern has scheduled activities for newly enrolled NU students. For a complete list of planned events visit <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/welcomeweek/"> Northeastern's Welcome Week site</a>.</span>

The Library is excited about participating in the activities! We have some plans in store so that students, new and old, can acquaint (or reacquaint) themselves with the Library and our services. Here is an overview:

<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ClubSnell: Live and In Person. </strong></span>Starting on Tuesday, September 6th and through Friday, September 9th, Snell Library will have a Welcome Week booth out on our front patio from 11am-1pm. Come and stop by with questions or for more information about research assistance, circulation and resources, text a librarian, or study spaces! We'll also have information about work study positions and upcoming events.

<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Check-In! </strong></span>While you're here, come in and explore the building. Check-in using foursquare to participate in our foursquare contests each day (starting Tuesday, September 6th) for the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <em>chance to win some neat prizes</em>. <span style="color: #000000;">For more information </span></span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.northeastern.edu//welcomeweek/m/foursquare.html">read our foursquare contest instructions</a>.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Library Tours.</strong></span> Stop by Snell Library for a short, 20-minute introduction to the Library and get a preview of how we can help you with your research. Tours are scheduled for Wednesday, September 7th from 1:30-1:50 and 3:00-3:20pm; Thursday, September 8th from 4:30-4:50pm; and Friday, September 9th from 11:45-12:05pm and 2:00-2:20pm.
