Snell Library has some great student employment positions available for the Fall in various departments like Marketing &amp; Advancement, Digital Media Design Studio, Circulation, and Resource Sharing. The Library is looking to hire work-study eligible students and part-time students for the fall semester or for the 2011-2012 school year. Working in Snell Library is both convenient and fun! The Library is located in the heart of Northeastern’s campus, which is the perfect place to work during the busy school season. Snell Library welcomes and values student employment, and  students love working here too!

As the Marketing and Event Planning Co-Op in Snell, I enjoy working in the Library because the staff are so friendly. Everyone is quick to help whenever I need it! You also cannot beat the 5 minute walk from on-campus housing..especially when winter comes!

William Bratches, the NU Archivist Co-op said he loves working in Snell because "[he] love[s] being surrounded by so much information and so many stories in the archive."
