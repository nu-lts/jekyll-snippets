I've just received the lineup of authors coming to Snell Library this fall to speak about their books.  It arrived in my email <em>and</em> my snail mail on the same day, which seemed fortuitous somehow.  Of course the first thing I did was scan to see if I had read any of the books (nope, not yet) or even heard of any of the authors (yes!).

What struck me as I examined the list was the terrific variety we have to offer.  Whether you're interested in history, women's studies, sports, journalism, marketing, politics, law, or just a few good fiction reads, there's an author coming to speak at Snell that you'll be interested in hearing from!

Stevens on 9/21, reading from <em><a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/index.php#Stevens" target="_blank">The Twilight Riders: The Last Charge of the 26th Cavalry,</a></em> another history book, this one about World War II.

Lou Imbriano, former Chief Marketing Officer for the New England Patriots, talks about his new book <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/index.php#Imbriano"><em>Winning the Customer</em></a>, which covers revenue-building marketing strategies from a top NFL CMO on 9/22.  And Martin Henn will present <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/index.php#Henn" target="_blank"><em>Under the Color of Law</em></a> about counterterrorism law and policy on 10/19, a timely topic in this 10th anniversary year of the Al-Qa'ida attacks.

Capping off the season is a very special event: <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/index.php#Vega"><em>An Evening with Al Vega</em></a> (11/17), hosted by acclaimed WGBH music announcer Ron Della Chiesa and Leonard Brown of Northeastern's Department of African American Studies and Music. Jazz pianist Al Vega, who attended Northeastern in the 1940s, will perform with his trio, and Prof. Brown will present his book about Vega, <em>Boston's Jazz Legend: the Al Vega Story</em>.  This event is open to Northeastern University faculty, staff and students.
