I've just received the lineup of authors coming to Snell Library this fall to speak about their books.  It arrived in my email _and_ my snail mail on the same day, which seemed fortuitous somehow.  Of course the first thing I did was scan to see if I had read any of the books (nope, not yet) or even heard of any of the authors (yes!).

What struck me as I examined the list was the terrific variety we have to offer.  Whether you're interested in history, women's studies, sports, journalism, marketing, politics, law, or just a few good fiction reads, there's an author coming to speak at Snell that you'll be interested in hearing from!

![Independence book cover](https://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?UserID=iii1neuniv&Password=neuniv&Return=1&type=S&Value=9781608190089) The season opens with John Ferling's [_Independence: The Stuggle to Set America Free_](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/index.php#Ferling) on 9/14 (you can never read enough about the Declaration of Independence, right?) followed by Peter F. Stevens on 9/21, reading from _[The Twilight Riders: The Last Charge of the 26th Cavalry,](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/index.php#Stevens)_ another history book, this one about World War II.

Lou Imbriano, former Chief Marketing Officer for the New England Patriots, talks about his new book [_Winning the Customer_](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/index.php#Imbriano), which covers revenue-building marketing strategies from a top NFL CMO on 9/22.  And Martin Henn will present [_Under the Color of Law_](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/index.php#Henn) about counterterrorism law and policy on 10/19, a timely topic in this 10th anniversary year of the Al-Qa'ida attacks.

![Braver headshot](http://www.garybraver.com/Garyright.gif)Interested in fiction? If so, meet Gary Braver, who reads from his new suspense novel, _[Tunnel Vision](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/index.php#Braver),_ on 10/26. This novel has won advance praise from none other than Ray Bradbury! Braver may be better known to you as Gary Goshgarian, longtime professor of English at Northeastern.

There's a trifecta of authors coming to discuss the role and status of women this fall: Joumana Haddad, author of [_I Killed Scheherazade: Confessions of an Angry Arab Woman_](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/index.php#Haddad) comes to Snell on 10/20, sports journalist Linda Cohn, author of [_Cohn-Head: A No-Holds-Barred Account of Breaking into the Boys Club_](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/index.php#Cohn) on 10/22, and Dr. Emily Fox Kales, author of _[Body Shots: Hollywood and the Culture of Eating Disorders](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/index.php#Kales) _on 11/16. _

Jazz pianist Al Vega, who attended Northeastern in the 1940s, will perform with his trio, and Prof. Brown will present his book about Vega, _Boston's Jazz Legend: the Al Vega Story_.  This event is open to Northeastern University faculty, staff and students.
