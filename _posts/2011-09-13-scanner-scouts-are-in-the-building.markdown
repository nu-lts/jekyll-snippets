To celebrate the new school year and the new scanning stations, students from the Library Marketing & Advancement office and members of the SGA have teamed up as "Scanner Scouts." Scouts will roam the floors of the Library looking for students using the new scanners. Students seen using the scanning machines will be offered a free Northeastern USB drive (like the one pictured below) and get their picture taken and uploaded to the library's social media sites. So don't miss out on this awesome promotion! It's only going on this week, so hurry over to the library and get caught using a scanner!

**More about the scanning stations:**
Located on floors 1-4 of the Library, these environmentally-friendly scanners are a green alternative to our old copy machines. They help save trees and reduce paper-use by allowing students to save the scanned image to their NU email, USB flash drive, or Google Docs account. If you still need a paper copy of the scanned document, they can print it out using the printers at the library. And the best part? The scanners are absolutely free! So go green and try one of the scanning stations today!
