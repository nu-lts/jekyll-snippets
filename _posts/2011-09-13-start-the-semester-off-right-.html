Get excited, Northeastern!

The new semester not only indicates a fresh beginning filled with new classes and different faces but also the start of our Fall Semester Author Events! What better way to kick off the semester than hearing from one of the leading historians of America's history? <strong>John Ferling</strong> will be coming to Northeastern University on <strong>Wednesday, September 14, 2011</strong> at <strong>12PM</strong> at <strong>90 Snell Library</strong> to talk about his newest book release, <em><strong>Independence: The Struggle to Set America Free.</strong></em> Ferling's new novel, which was deemed by Dan Rather to be "mesmerising, masterful," offers the readers fascinating, eye-opening insight into the revolution stirred up in order to obtain America's long-awaited independence.

According to author, Andrew Burstein, of <em>Jefferson's Secrets</em>, "Independence is rich in personality, and Ferling unsurpassed as an authority. There is no ordinary history." In addition to <em><span class="Apple-style-span">Independence, </span></em>Ferling has written numerous novels, including <em>The Ascent of George Washington </em>and <em>Setting The World Ablaze, </em>that allow his readers to indulge in America's history. <em> </em>Come listen to Ferling discuss this compelling story of our nation, and enjoy the free refreshments provided. Following the event, the NU Bookstore will be there so that you can have your very own copy of the acclaimed novel!
