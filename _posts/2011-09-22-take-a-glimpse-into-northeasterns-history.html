Perhaps you have noticed the Library's redesigned display board on the first floor in the stairwell? It now features historical photos of Northeastern University from the University's<a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/" target="_blank"> Archives and Special Collections</a>. Included with each image is a brief description about the photo and the date each was taken. These images range from the First World Series game to the first few engineering classes held on campus. Check out the board and catch a glimpse of a time when our Husky Pride began. To see the full digital collection of Northeastern University historical photographs, visit <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/nuphotos" target="_blank">http://www.lib.neu.edu/nuphotos</a> or stop in Archives, located in 92 Snell Library.
