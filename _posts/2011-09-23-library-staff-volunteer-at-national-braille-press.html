On Thursday, September 22nd a group of staff volunteers from Northeastern University's Snell Library spent the afternoon at the <a href="http://www.nbp.org/">National Braille Press</a> located at 88 Saint Stephen Street (in the midst of Northeastern's campus). Once on-site, staff took a tour of the facility and learned about the braille production process which includes transcription, proofreading, embossing, pressing, tactile graphics and finishing. After the tour they formed an assembly line in order to add braille to 250 pre-published children's books. The books they helped assemble were copies of Eric Carle's,<em> From Head to Toe</em>, which will be sent to blind children across the country. Check out the pictures below from the day! The National Braille Press is always looking for volunteers so if you are interested visit <a href="http://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/support/volunteer.html">http://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/support/volunteer.html</a> to learn more.
