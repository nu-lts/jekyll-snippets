On Thursday, September 22, [Lou Imbriano](http://www.louimbriano.com/) came to Snell Library as part of our [Fall 2011 Meet the Author Series](http://www.lib.neu.edu/about_us/news_events/).

Fans of sports and fans of innovative business techniques came to hear Imbriano speak about his experiences in the marketing industry and the importance of forming positive relationships with consumer. The always engaging Imbriano explained his business acronym D.E.L.I.V.E.R.S. to the audience, which signifies his commitment to strengthening relationships with old and new clients. He stressed the importance of making clients feel special and creating positive memories with them. Imbriano also provided plenty of real-world success stories of his techniques, including examples of how he used his strategies with high-profile clients such as the New England Patriots.
