****An article on a revision of the US Government’s socio-economic index, published in 1982 in the journal, _Social Science Research_, has been cited by other articles in a broad array of academic journals over 300 times, with the most recent citation being from an article published in June 2011. By extending our offering of _[_Web of Science _](http://0-apps.webofknowledge.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/WOS_GeneralSearch_input.do?product=WOS&search_mode=GeneralSearch&SID=1Ab37kjjkA1apk9Bbfk&preferencesSaved=)_back files from 1975 through 1992, we are able to provide Northeastern researchers with these historical statistics, allowing them to identify the most important articles, journals, institutions, and authors in their field or subject area of study.

When viewing any article in the _Web of Science_ database, a list of citations from that article are provided as well as a list of other subsequent articles and conference proceedings that cite the original article. Links connect to the full text of the cited articles when the full text is available. And don’t be fooled by the title of this database.  As the above example illustrates,_ Web of Science_ covers scholarly articles in all types of sciences that include journals in the humanities and social sciences.
