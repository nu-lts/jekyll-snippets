Snell Library now has three new staff members on its team: Erin Beach, Jennifer Ferguson, and Greg McClellan.

Erin Beach, in her new role at NU Libraries, will be a full-time Circulation Supervisor for Consortial Borrowing & Lending.  In addition to staffing and supervising the circulation desk, Erin will coordinate the NExpress and WorldCat Navigator materials processing.  Erin has worked in the Resource Sharing unit as a student and part-time employee for the past two years.  She is a 2009 graduate of Brown University where she majored in English Literature,  and a 2011 graduate of Northeastern University where she also majored in English.  Erin is interested in pursuing a professional career as a library archivist.

Jennifer Ferguson joined us this September as a Data Services Librarian, a newly created position within the Research and Instruction Services department.  A major responsibility of the Data Services Librarian will be to focus on data management and curation, and on data resources that faculty and students can utilize in their research and publishing activities.  Jen will also be the group leader of the new Science, Engineering and Math Liaison Group and play a key role in developing an even stronger liaison program.  Jennifer comes to us from Brandeis University, where she was a Research and Instruction Librarian.  She also serves on the New England E-Science Portal Virtual Community and contributes to the Bioinformatics Core project at the HarvardSchool of Public Health.

Last but certainly not least, Greg McClellan joined us this August in the role of Senior Digital Library Developer, adding important new capacities to our technology portfolio. Greg comes to us from the Brandeis library staff where he served as Senior Systems Librarian. Prior to his time at Brandeis, Greg worked in library technology positions at Lesley University, MIT and Cornell, and he has worked with many open source projects, including VuFind and dSpace. Greg joins the Library Technology Services staff and will work with his tech colleagues on a variety of programming projects including the digital repository, as well as various work flow automation ideas.

The Library welcomes each of you and wishes you the best in your new positions!
