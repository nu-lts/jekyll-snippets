Quite recently, the well-known New York owner of Arader Galleries, Graham Arader, has made available to the University a number of antique framed prints and maps. These one-of-a-kind pieces are filled with colorful outlines and unique drawings, which makes the prints and maps even more aesthetically pleasing.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/DSC06768.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4223 aligncenter" src="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/DSC06768-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="250" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The collection is fortunately available for public viewing as it is also incorporated into the course, 'Picturing the World,' taught by Dean Georges Van Den Abbeele of CSSH this fall. The course gears towards introducing freshmen to the natural world and technological breakthrough that enabled early modern printing used for books, art prints, and maps.</p>
