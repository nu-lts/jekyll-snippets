Northeastern University Professor of History William Fowler was featured on NPR yesterday to answer questions about Christopher Columbus' momentous journey to the 'New World' and to bust common myths that people associate with it.Â The interview covered everything from Columbus' faulty expectations for the trip to the real names of the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria. The full conversation can be read or listened to <a title="here" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=141164702" target="_blank">here</a>.
