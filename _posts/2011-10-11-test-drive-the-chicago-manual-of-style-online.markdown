Many of us are familiar with the _Chicago Manual of Style_ (CMOS) and use it as a reference while writing. Now Snell Library is providing[ online access to the CMOS's 15th and 16th editions](http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/articles/database_trials1/chicago_manual/) in one easy location.

New online-only features include:



	
  * Being able to search the CMOS and specify either the 15th or 16th edition

	
  * A [Q&A section](http://0-www.chicagomanualofstyle.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/CMS_FAQ/new/new_questions01.html) that answers those tricky questions as submitted by users -- including a place to submit your own questions


The 16th edition, published in 2010, is updated for the digital age. All of us have run across one of those pesky hard-to-answer citation questions. "How do I reference a [Twitter post](http://0-www.chicagomanualofstyle.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/CMS_FAQ/new/new_questions01.html)? What about a [blog entry](http://0-www.chicagomanualofstyle.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/16/ch14/ch14_sec246.html)? Or a [podcast](http://0-www.chicagomanualofstyle.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/16/ch14/ch14_sec221.html)?" For those of you who are editors or writers, there is now an [electronic editing checklist](http://0-www.chicagomanualofstyle.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/16/ch02/ch02_sec133.html) to help you in your online editing ventures.

Don’t forget to check out Northeastern University Libraries' access to the [AMA Manual of Style](http://0-www.amamanualofstyle.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/oso/public/index.html), and here is a general guide to [MLA, APA, Chicago, and CSE styles](http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/resdoc5e/).
