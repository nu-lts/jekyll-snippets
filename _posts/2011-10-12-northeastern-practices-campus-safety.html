Today and tomorrow, from 12:30-2:30pm, representatives from the NUPD and SGA will be in the Library and Curry Student Center to communicate to students the importance of campus safety. Please always be aware of your belongings and surroundings to help prevent accidents and theft on and around campus. If you have any questions about the safety campaign you can contact Detective Jonathan Boyd at 617-373-8356. And don't forget, the Library has <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=3321">laptop locks</a> that are available at the Circulation Desk for your use!
