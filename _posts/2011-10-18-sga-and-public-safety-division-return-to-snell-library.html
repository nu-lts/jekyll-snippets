On Thursday, October 20th, from 12 to 2pm,  Northeastern's Student Government Association and the Public Safety Division will be back to Snell Library and the Curry Student Center to talk to students, faculty, and staff about campus safety. They will be reminding people to not leave their belongings unattended and to keep their valuables secure at all times. The goal of these meet and greets is to encourage students to be aware of their surroundings and property in order to reduce theft on campus. If you have any questions, please contact Detective Jonathan Boyd of the Northeastern University Police department at 617-373-8356.
