Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) is working with libraries in an important study of online library information services and <em>WorldCat</em>. They are inviting students to participate in a focus group to enable them to better understand how you search, find and use information for both your personal and study needs. Students should share their opinions and insights about how they get and use information on OCLCâ€™s <em>WorldCat</em> database. OCLC will select students for the focus group interviews who have used <em>WorldCat</em> or are willing to try to use <em>WorldCat</em>. The focus group session will take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours and will be held in Snell Library Room 421 at <strong>2:30-4:30pm on Wednesday 26<sup>th</sup> October 2011</strong>.

If you are interested in participating, please respond to Simon Wakeling at <a href="mailto:s.wakeling@sheffield.ac.uk">s.wakeling@sheffield.ac.uk</a>. Numbers are limited so he will accept replies on a first come first served basis.
