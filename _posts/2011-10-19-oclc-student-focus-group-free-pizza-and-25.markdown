Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) is working with libraries in an important study of online library information services and _WorldCat_. They are inviting students to participate in a focus group to enable them to better understand how you search, find and use information for both your personal and study needs. Students should share their opinions and insights about how they get and use information on OCLCâ€™s _WorldCat_ database. OCLC will select students for the focus group interviews who have used _WorldCat_ or are willing to try to use _WorldCat_. The focus group session will take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours and will be held in Snell Library Room 421 at **2:30-4:30pm on Wednesday 26th October 2011**.

****As well as providing pizza, we will also give $25 cash to all students that attend.****

If you are interested in participating, please respond to Simon Wakeling at [s.wakeling@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:s.wakeling@sheffield.ac.uk). Numbers are limited so he will accept replies on a first come first served basis.

All responses will be kept strictly confidential. The principal investigators of the project are Dr. Lynn Silipigni Connaway (Senior Research Scientist OCLC) and Simon Wakeling (Doctoral Student, Information School, University of Sheffield).
