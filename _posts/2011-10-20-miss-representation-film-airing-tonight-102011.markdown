A powerful film about women will be televised on the OWN network at 9pm tonight.

The film [Miss Representation](http://blogs.laweekly.com/stylecouncil/2011/10/miss_representation_jennifer_s.php) "explores women's under-representation in positions of power by challenging their limited and often disparaging portrayals in the media," according to the description from the OWN Documentary Club web site. Appearing in the film are such notables as Condoleezza Rice, Nancy Pelosi, Katie Couric, Rachel Maddow, Margaret Cho, Rosario Dawson, and Gloria Steinem.
