![](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/200px-Open_Access_logo_PLoS_white.svg_.png)Join us at 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday, October 25, in 90 Snell Library for a webcast on open science, hosted by the [Berkman Center for Internet and Society](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University.

[Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/michael-a-nielsen/), author and an advocate of open science, will discuss opportunities for collaboration in the sciences using online tools such as blogs and wikis. In particular, the [Polymath Project](http://polymathprojects.org/) illustrates the possibility that such tools can be used to transform the way we work together to make scientific discoveries. Audience members will have the ability to participate in discussion via Twitter.
