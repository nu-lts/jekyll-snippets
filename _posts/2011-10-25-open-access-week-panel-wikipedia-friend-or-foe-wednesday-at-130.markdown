Join us on **Wednesday at 1:30 in Snell Library room 421** for a panel discussion that is sure to engage both students and their instructors. Three Northeastern faculty members - Jeff Howe (Journalism), Joseph Reagle (Communication), and Heidi Wilkes (CPS) - will discuss Wikipedia, crowdsourcing, and social networking tools as components of the research process. There will be plenty of time for audience discussion afterwards.
