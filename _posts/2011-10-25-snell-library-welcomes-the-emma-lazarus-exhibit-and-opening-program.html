Come join Snell Library in opening the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/emmalazarus/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Emma Lazarus: Voice of Liberty, Voice of Conscience</em></strong></a> Public Exhibit on <strong>October 27th</strong>. The exhibit will run until December 16 on the first floor of Snell Library and will illustrate the fascinating life of Emma Lazarus. Through her poetry, criticism, and advocacy for the poor, immigrants, and refugees, Emma Lazarus has left a lasting impression. The exhibit was created to recognize her influence, her life, and especially her poetry.
