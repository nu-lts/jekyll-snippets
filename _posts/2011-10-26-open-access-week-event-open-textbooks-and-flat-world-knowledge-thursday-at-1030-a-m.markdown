![](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/200px-Open_Access_logo_PLoS_white.svg_.png)Join us on **Thursday, October 27, at 10:30 a.m. in 90 Snell Library** for a presentation on open textbooks. Michael Boezi, editorial director of [Flat World Knowledge](http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/), the leading commercial publisher of open textbooks, will speak on "**Keeping Education Accessible: The Textbook Affordability Crisis and Emerging Open Solutions.**"
High textbook prices increasingly challenge the mission of many institutions to provide affordable, quality education. The emerging trend of open content is reshaping the publishing landscape, allowing for the rise of new business models that:



	
  1. significantly reduce the cost of high-quality learning materials, and thereby the overall cost of education;

	
  2. meet the growing demand for alternate, flexible formats that keep pace with the different ways we consume information; and

	
  3. provide authors with a forward-looking compensation model.


Boezi will discuss the emerging trend of open content, examining the advantages (and challenges) of "open" as it relates to textbooks, as well as the economic, social, and technology drivers that are transforming education and propelling the growth of free, low-cost, and open alternatives to expensive, traditional college textbooks.

Refreshments will be served.
