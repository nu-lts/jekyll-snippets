With the craze of midterm week gradually dying down, students can now look forward to relaxing in November. However, what many students may not know about the month of November is that it marks the festive celebration of Native American Heritage Month, which aims to highlight the establishment, growth, and exceptional work that Native Americans have carried out over the past hundreds of years. Students can honor this month by checking out one of the many resources Snell Library offers to educate Northeastern University on the extensive contributions Native Americans have made. Here are some examples that could be found right here at Snell!

The novel, <strong><em>Tribal Theory in Native American Literature</em></strong>, by Penelope Myrtle Kelsey explores how one might implement tribal knowledge into theoretical framework when reading the text of Native Americans.
