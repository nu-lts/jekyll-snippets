Next time you are working in a group, sign out one of Snell Library's available group study spaces and and gather around one of the recently added media:scape tables. Located on the first floor, these four innovative new stations feature a large monitor that students can display their laptop screens on when they plug into the table's central outlet. No longer will students have to crowd around one person's single, small laptop screen or individually work from their own computers. The media:scape stations allow students to easily view and share their work with other group members in a productive and efficient manner. The modernly designed tables are functional, sleek, and vary in layout. Some have two monitors and some only have one, some can seat four while others can seat six, and some have stool seating while others are at desk height. Regardless of the layout, each table has plenty of room for students to spread their projects out and comfy chairs to work for hours in.

The implementation of these new media:scape tables were ultimately a direct result of student feedback. Last fall, the Library added three media:scape stations to test out for a few months. Students found them to be very useful and the University decided to purchase these tables for the library.

Hopefully, the media:scape tables will encourage more student collaboration on assignments. With the stations' innovative technology, comfy chairs, and spacious tables, students might even look forward toward working on a group project!
