I just found out about a very cool event: this Thursday, 11/17/11, at MIT at 7pm, there will be a screening of the documentary film [_We Still Live Here - As Nutayunean_](http://www.makepeaceproductions.com/wampfilm.html). This film is about the efforts of the Wampanoag Indian Tribe of Massachusetts to revive their language after the death of the last native speaker. [A copy has been purchased for Snell Library and is on reserve](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2490340~S19), so you can view it on your own at any time, but the screening at MIT will also feature a question-and-answer session afterward with the filmmaker and several linguists who have worked with the tribe on the language reclamation project. See [this MIT calendar listing](http://whamit.dlp.mit.edu/2011/11/15/film-about-wampanaog-language-revival-this-thursday/) for more information.

The film will also air on the PBS program _Independent Lens_ in the near future. [Check your local listings for airtimes](http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/broadcast.html).
