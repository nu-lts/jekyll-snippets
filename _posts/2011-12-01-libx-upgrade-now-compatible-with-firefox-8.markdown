Firefox seems to be on an update tear these days. We're glad to report that [Northeastern’s browser plugin, LibX](http://libx.org/editions/downloadlibx2.php?edition=7A08CE52), which lets you drag and drop searches, right-click to log in to an e-journal, and find citations in our collections, is now compatible with Firefox version 8.

If you’ve already upgraded, Firefox 8 probably warned you that it deleted LibX. Of course you want to get it back! So [go to our LibX page](http://libx.org/editions/downloadlibx2.php?edition=7A08CE52) to reinstall the latest edition.

If you haven’t upgraded to Firefox 8, if you do so starting today, your upgrade should automatically include the new LibX edition for Northeastern.

If you don’t know what Northeastern’s LibX browser plugin is, or what it can do, [see our earlier post with information and examples](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=3338).
