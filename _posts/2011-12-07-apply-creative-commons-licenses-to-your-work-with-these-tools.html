<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4552" align="left" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px" src="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cc.large_-e1323294227826.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" />Next time you're writing a paper, putting together a presentation, uploading a video to YouTube, or updating your website, why not tell your audience that you've decided to expand access to your work? <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/" target="_blank">With a Creative Commons license, <strong>you keep your copyright</strong> but allow people to copy and distribute your work provided they give you credit â€” and only on the conditions you specify.</a></p>

If you have a PC and use Microsoft Office products like Word and PowerPoint, you can get a free add-in that makes it easy to include a Creative Commons license. Read more about it and download the add-in here:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13303" target="_blank">For Windows 7 and Vista, MS Office 2007 and 2010</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=18413" target="_blank">For Windows XP, MS Office 2003</a></li>
</ul>
To include CC licenses elsewhere (anywhere!), the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/" target="_blank">Creative Commons license chooser</a> offers the ability to select the criteria you want your license to include and then provides you with the relevant text and an image to use (including HTML for use on the web). In addition, Creative Commons offers <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking/Creators" target="_blank">best practices for marking your work as CC-licensed</a> in a variety of formats, including images and video. Sites like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/creative_commons" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/account/prefs/license/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> also offer the option of applying a Creative Commons license when you upload your stuff.
