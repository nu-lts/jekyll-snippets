Did you get a Kindle, Nook, or, lucky you, an iPad for the holidays?  Have you been wondering if you can just download something fun to read on the bus, using the library?

Well, you can! If you want information about what you can do with different devices, see our <a href="http://library.northeastern.edu/get-help/e-books-devices">E-books and Devices page.</a>

And keep this in mind:
<ol>
	<li>If you like to read non-fiction (handbooks, essays, biography), there's plenty to read. There's not much e-book fiction available yet through Northeastern.</li>
	<li>The brave new world of digital rights management means that the first time you download a library e-book, you'll need to install software and set up an account.</li>
</ol>
Here's what I'm currently reading:

Denis Noble, <em>The music of life</em> about the definition of "life" in the age biogenetics.  I'm reading this now on an iPhone 3 from ebrary and all I can say is the material is fairly dense and intense for my itty bitty smartphone screen.

<em>Vintage Amis</em>: a collection of essays by Martin Amis, the great English writer, downloaded to my Nook.  The essays are pretty light nonfiction, and just about right for an e-reading device.

Here are some other gems available electronically:
