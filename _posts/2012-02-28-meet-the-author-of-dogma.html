Tomorrow, Wednesday, February 29th, Lars Iyer is coming to Northeastern to talk about his new book, <em>Dogma</em>, as a part of Snell Library's Meet the Author series.

Iyer, a senior lecturer in philosophy at Newcastle University in the United Kingdom, will be presenting <em>Dogma</em>, the sequel to his 2010 hit <em>Spurious</em>. The new novel continues the adventures of British intellectuals Lars and W., who embark on a drunken lecture tour through the American South. Proving to be another colossal mistake, the duo turn to Dogma, a semi-religious code of their own making based on their philosophical studies. Part Nietzsche, part Monty Python, part Huckleberry Finn, <em>Dogma</em> is a novel as ridiculous and profound as religion itself.

The presentation will start at 12pm noon tomorrow in room 90 of Snell Library. Refreshments will be served, and a book signing by Iyer will follow the event. Don't miss it!
