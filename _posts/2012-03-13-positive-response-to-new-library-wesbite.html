The newly redesigned Northeastern University Libraries' website has been successfully running since its launch over a month ago. The new and improved site reflects our instution's commitment to improving access to online library services and resources across campus and to remote locations. With new features such as a retooled menu, site search, easy-to-use drop down menu, 24/7 online help chat, question of the week, and engaging polls and news, the website has enabled students, faculty, and the community at large to have easier access to the vast resources the library has to offer.

After its launch, the new website sparked much interest within the community. Based on comments from the library's online survey, students are very pleased with the redesigned website. Students said the new website has "easier-to-find-accesses, nice and neat interface" and "more attractive layout." One undergraduate even remarked that "it looks great, very professional. Easy to use!"

Even members outside the Northeastern community are taking notice of the new website and are very impressed with what they see. Ruth Thomas from Mugar Library at Boston University said, "You at Northeastern Libraries are surely deservedly proud of your new website-- one of the most user-friendly and informative I've seen in all my roamings to other libraries' sites!" Carl Jones, Digital Library Systems Manager at MIT agreed with Thomas: "Seconded. Very nice, indeed."

With such positive responses from both inside and outside of the community, those involved with the creation of the website are extrememly pleased.  The library encourages more feedback about the new wesbite in order to continue making improvements and to allow the Northeastern community to have the access and resources to all that the Library has to offer.
