Have you ever slogged through an experimental protocol, trying to understand exactly what the authors did in the lab?  Have you ever tried to learn about research methods in other disciplines, just to get bogged down in terminology?  Now there’s a more visual alternative.

The library is pleased to offer access to <a href="http://0-www.jove.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/" target="_blank">JoVE, the Journal of Visualized Experiments</a>.  JoVE publishes professionally produced and edited, peer-reviewed video demonstrations of experiments filmed in research laboratories. This revolutionary resource allows students and researchers to watch experts perform techniques before attempting experiments themselves.  Just getting started in the lab?  JoVE has a <a href="http://0-www.jove.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/basic" target="_blank">Basic Protocols</a> section where you can learn everything from microscope care to Western blotting.

JoVE also features video articles from NEU scientists in the departments of Bioengineering, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Electrical and Computer Engineering.

We invite you to check out JoVE, and let us know what you think!
