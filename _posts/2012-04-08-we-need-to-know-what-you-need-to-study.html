UPDATE 5/1/12: We have closed the survey data collection, thank you to everyone who shared their experience on this survey! If you are interested in the results of the survey, please watch this space, or contact me directly, at t.urell@neu.edu.

Do you come in to study in Snell but you can't find a place to sit? Is your favorite group study room always booked? Need more power outlets? We want to know!

This spring the Library will be asking for your help in collecting information about how study space is configured in Snell. We're conducting <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/snell-snippets" target="_blank">a quick survey</a> about study habits, preferences for space and furniture, and we will use the information to shape Library development over the next few years.

<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/snell-snippets" target="_blank">Please take a few minutes to let us know what space and furniture you use, what you would like to see more of, and any other feedback or suggestions you have about study space in Snell.</a> The survey shouldn't take more than five minutes, your responses will remain anonymous, and each response will help us shape the Library's study space.

If you would prefer to fill out a paper version of the same survey, copies are available at the Circulation (1st floor) and Research Assistance (2nd floor) desks in the Library.

Questions? Send me an email at t.urell[at]neu.edu

Thanks for your help in creating a better Library!
