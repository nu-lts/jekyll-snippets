Over the past few weeks we have been administering a survey in order to collect information on what Library users need and want more of in terms of study space. The survey asked users questions about where they like to study and what type of spaces should the Library have more of, allowing the Library to learn what users really want for their library that will enable them to have their ideal study space. Users were able to take the survey online or on paper, which was handed out during different times of the day at the Library and other areas on campus, such as the Curry Student Center.

We’ve had a great response, reaching about 1,000 completed surveys, with respondents from all colleges and divisions of the University.** A big Thank You to everyone who took the survey, in print or online!** With all of your helpful responses, we have generated important information that will help shape the Library’s planning now, as well as its long term development.
