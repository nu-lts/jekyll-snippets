Here we are, a month into baseball season, and my beloved Red Sox are showing few signs of emerging from their prolonged slump. Yet they still (so far, anyway!) are maintaining the longest sold-out-games streak in history. Want to check their attendance numbers versus those of other MLB teams? <a href="http://0-www.sbrnet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/research.asp?subrid=649#babat1" title="Yearly MLB attendance by team, via SBRnet" target="_blank">SBRnet can do that</a>.

Brave enough to bike around Boston? (Not me, thanks.) That has the potential to be an expensive hobby. How much do US consumers spend annually on their bicycling habits? <a href="http://0-www.sbrnet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/research.asp?subRID=579#bictot1" title="US annual bicycling expenditures, via SBRnet" target="_blank">SBRnet's got that information as well</a>.

Maybe you want to advertise a product to female TV viewers of sporting events. But which sports do women watch on television the most? <a href="http://0-www.sbrnet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/fanreports.asp" title="Sports Fan Market Links, via SBRnet" target="_blank">SBRnet can link you to TV Viewing Profiles for all televised sports</a>.
