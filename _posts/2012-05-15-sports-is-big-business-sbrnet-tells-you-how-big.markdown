Here we are, a month into baseball season, and my beloved Red Sox are showing few signs of emerging from their prolonged slump. Yet they still (so far, anyway!) are maintaining the longest sold-out-games streak in history. Want to check their attendance numbers versus those of other MLB teams? [SBRnet can do that](http://0-www.sbrnet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/research.asp?subrid=649#babat1).

Brave enough to bike around Boston? (Not me, thanks.) That has the potential to be an expensive hobby. How much do US consumers spend annually on their bicycling habits? [SBRnet's got that information as well](http://0-www.sbrnet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/research.asp?subRID=579#bictot1).

Maybe you want to advertise a product to female TV viewers of sporting events. But which sports do women watch on television the most? [SBRnet can link you to TV Viewing Profiles for all televised sports](http://0-www.sbrnet.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/fanreports.asp).

[SBRnet](http://library.northeastern.edu/find/resources/items/sbrnet-sport-business-research-network) is a great tool for sport marketing and business information. It includes statistical data, news, research, and reports on topics such as sport participation, fan profiles, sports facilities, sport finance, sporting goods, sponsorship, marketing, and media.

If you are interested in the business of sports, take a moment to poke around in [SBRnet](http://library.northeastern.edu/find/resources/items/sbrnet-sport-business-research-network). And as always, let us know what you think, either in the comments below or by [contacting us here](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/contact-us).
