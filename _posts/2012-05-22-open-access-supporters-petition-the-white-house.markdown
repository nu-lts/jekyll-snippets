[Update] On June 3rd, the petition supporters reached their goal of 25,000 signatures!

This year, the Obama administration has been actively considering the issue of public access to the results of federally funded research. The administration is currently considering which policy actions are priorities that will it will act on before the 2012 presidential election season begins in earnest. Supporters of  open access to research results hope to demonstrate a strong public interest in expanding the [NIH Public Access Policy](http://publicaccess.nih.gov/FAQ.htm) across all U.S. federal science agencies. As a supporter of open access to information, I agree with them.

On Monday**, [a petition calling for public access to federally funded research](https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/!/petition/require-free-access-over-internet-scientific-journal-articles-arising-taxpayer-funded-research/wDX82FLQ)** was posted on the White House's "We the People" site.  If the petition garners **25,000 signatures within 30 days**, it will be reviewed by White House staff, and **considered for action.** I've signed the petition, and so have over 7,000 other people as of today.
