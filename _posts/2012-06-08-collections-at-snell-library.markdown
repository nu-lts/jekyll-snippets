In partnership with the organization You Can Play, [Northeastern University Athletics has recently recorded a PSA supporting equality in sports](http://gonu.com/news/2012/6/7/GEN_0607124629.aspx). Northeastern student- athletes, coaches, administrators,and fans came together to express their support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender athletes, promoting their message that sexual orientation has no bearing in sport: **if you can play, you can play**. In their partnership with You Can Play, NU Athletics is been committed to creating an open, inclusive and supporting culture at Northeastern for LGBT athletes and students.
