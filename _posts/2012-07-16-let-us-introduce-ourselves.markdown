_This July I am one of three new co-ops who will be working in Snell Library through the Fall semester. We are all very excited for the months ahead and would love to introduce ourselves (before people start thinking we just spend all day, everyday, in the library... although we love Snell and would if we could!)_

Marketing and Events Co-op

My name is Jen Anderle and I am the new Marketing and Events Co-op in Snell Library’s Advancement office. I am a middler majoring in Art and minoring in Business Administration. This semester I will be working on marketing and organizing library events as well as communicating daily happenings at Snell Library to the Northeastern Community. Otherwise, I enjoy sailing, painting and travelling.





We look forward to working with everyone!
