BIG THINGS are coming to the library this summer. The University is building <strong>a new collaborative learning environment</strong> on the second floor of Snell. To get started, we've <a href="http://library.northeastern.edu/news-events/library-news/moving-the-snell-library-2nd-floor-print-collections" target="_blank">cleared away all the print collections</a>, <a href="http://library.northeastern.edu/get-help/ask-a-librarian" target="_blank">relocated research assistance services to the first floor</a>, and construction starts this week.

The new space <strong>will open for Fall 2012</strong>.

So what does “a new collaborative learning environment” mean?

It means <strong>new technology </strong>and<strong> new workspaces </strong>and<strong> new outlets, </strong>plenty of new outlets.

You’ll have to please <strong>excuse any noise, disruption, and the inconvenience during construction</strong>. The library will stay open <a href="http://library.northeastern.edu/about/visitors/hours">regular service hours</a>, but the second floor is off line as study space until the re-opening in the fall.

Watch the library website and signs around the building, we will be posting architects’ drawings soon!
