BIG THINGS are coming to the library this summer. The University is building **a new collaborative learning environment** on the second floor of Snell. To get started, we've [cleared away all the print collections](http://library.northeastern.edu/news-events/library-news/moving-the-snell-library-2nd-floor-print-collections), [relocated research assistance services to the first floor](http://library.northeastern.edu/get-help/ask-a-librarian), and construction starts this week.

The new space **will open for Fall 2012**.

So what does “a new collaborative learning environment” mean?

It means **new technology **and** new workspaces **and** new outlets, **plenty of new outlets.

You’ll have to please **excuse any noise, disruption, and the inconvenience during construction**. The library will stay open [regular service hours](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/visitors/hours), but the second floor is off line as study space until the re-opening in the fall.

Watch the library website and signs around the building, we will be posting architects’ drawings soon!
