_There are 42 days until the first day of fall semester classes.  That’s six solid weeks; more than enough time to take advantage of the rest of the summer by reading some great books!_

_Here are some suggestions from our library staff to get you started. Click on the book title to see the record for the book in our collection._ -- Jen

### _[River of Smoke](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/river-of-smoke-amitav-ghosh/1100816164) _




### by Amitav Ghosh


_Suggested by [Will Wakeling](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/will-wakeling)_

I’m just finishing Amitav Ghosh's River of Smoke, the 2nd volume of the historical trilogy begun with the wonderful and exotic _[Sea of Poppies](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2201572~S19)_. Everything you ever wanted to know about the early 19th century opium trade into Canton and southern China. A great way to learn the basics of Chinese Pidgin English, too – worth a "look-see."

### _**[Bring Up the Bodies](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2690897~S19)**_




### by Hilary Mantel


_Suggested by [Ethan Bren](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/ethan-bren)_

I read Bring Up the Bodies by Hilary Mantel. It’s the sequel to [Wolf Hall](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2262368~S19), which won the Man Booker Prize in 2009. Both books are really terrific pieces of historical fiction that I enjoyed immensely.

###  _**[Graceling](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2218923~S19)**_




### by Kristin Cashore

My vote would be for Graceling and its sequel, [Bitterblue](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2690526~S19), and the companion as well, [Fire](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2274049~S19) – all of which we own!  Written by a local (squee!), it's a beautifully crafted fantasy tale about two delightfully strong and unorthodox ladies in a Tolkien-meets-King-Arthur sort of way.

I’ve been suggesting them like a crazy person to anyone who asks, and I’ve not had bad feedback yet.

Take that, Twilight!

### **_[Canada](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2690981~S19)_**
by Richard Ford


_Suggested by [Jamie Dendy](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/jamie-dendy)_

It carries one away through a riveting plot, yet drops one on the ground from time to time to ponder issues of crime and inheritance.

### _**[The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2174008~S19)**_
by Leonard Mlodinow


_Suggested by [Jen Ferguson](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/jen-ferguson)_

What I'm loving about it: Who knew that a book about probability could be so engaging?







Now go forth and capture some quality summer days! Soak up the weather, drink something sweet and cold, and read your book way too fast.
