With just weeks remaining in the summer, you're going to have to jump into your summer reading if you haven't yet gotten started! We collected a first round of staff picks in [part one](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=5110) to give you some summer reading suggestions, but if nothing looked interesting to you, or you're still waiting for the right book... here are some more options.

Let us know in the comments, below, what you're enjoying this summer, and if you've read any of these, what you thought of them.

### By Seth Grahame-Smith


Suggested by [Ernesto Valencia](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/ernesto-valencia)

Abe Lincoln Killing Vampires and abolishing slavery! What’s not to like!?

### By Hilary Mantel


(Apparently a big hit among Snell staff!)

Highly recommended by [Karen Merguerian](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/karen-merguerian), [Ernesto Valencia](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/ernesto-valencia), and [Ethan Bren](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/ethan-bren)

### By John Crowley


Suggested by [Tom Urell](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/thomas-urell)

I read this early this summer, and can't get it out of my head. Like an arabesque or a mandala, the more you look into it, the further it goes. Ostensibly an epic family saga, _Little, Big_ seems modest at first, but then grows into a rich universe of its own.

### By George R.R Martin


Suggested by [Ernesto Valencia](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/ernesto-valencia)

Because court intrigue and epic fantasies are fun!

### by Geraldine McCaughrean


Suggested by [Hillary Corbett](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/hillary-corbett)

It’s a real page-turner! I picked it up because I love anything about Antarctica – and although I was a little skeptical of the far-fetched plot at first, I found it to be gripping, masterfully written, and totally believable. It’s classified as a young adult novel, although I think it could easily be shelved in adult literature.

### by Steve Martin


Suggested by [Jen Anderle](http://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/jen-anderle)

This is a humorous yet elegantly written novel about the fine art world of Manhattan and the people that live in it. Steve Martin’s main character starts as an equal in complexity and allure to the pieces she works among and tragically wastes away like a passing fad. Yet another example of Steve Martin's talent!










So there you go. And if you still aren't interested in one of our suggestions, [the library has hundreds of thousands of print books in the stacks and almost as many e-books online](http://library.northeastern.edu/find/resources/books-and-ebooks).  One of them is bound to be your perfect end-of-summer read.




What's your summer pick?
