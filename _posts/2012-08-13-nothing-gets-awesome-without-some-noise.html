Each night for the past couple of weeks, construction workers have descended on Snell Library’s second floor. Late night Snell dwellers have probably already been hearing the drilling and banging noises coming from behind the white plastic walls.

Unfortunately This week we will have to take it up a notch.

But we all know how transformations go.

In extreme weight-loss shows, contestants cry, scream and grunt as they flip giant tires and push other things around. And in home makeover shows there are always demolition days and the constant rumbling of power tools, even moving busses and screaming crowds in the end.

Our own makeover will not be this extreme, but there will be some noise during the day this week. <strong>From 6:30am to 3:30pm this week there will be some construction noise</strong> coming from the second floor.

We apologize for any disruption that this noise will cause. It will be over soon and I know you will agree that it will be worth it.

We have made <strong>free earplugs available</strong> at the circulation desk for anyone who would like them. Feel free to pick up a pair and who knows, they may make your time at Snell more peaceful than ever.
