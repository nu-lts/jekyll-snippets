On average, Snell Library welcomes almost five thousand visitors through its doors each day.  This means that we need to be able to accommodate each type of user and provide as many resources for their needs as possible.    We basically need to be everything to everyone, and so we start our Customize Snell campaign.

We have re-vamped and clarified the acceptable noise guidelines for each floor.  We expect that this will provide a more standardized noise level on each floor and library users will in turn have a better experience at Snell library.

<strong>First Floor:</strong>

Noise Level: 65 decibels and above
Examples of 65 dB:
<ul>
	<li>Dolphin echolocation</li>
	<li>Your average day in the rainforest</li>
	<li>The sound of productivity and engagement</li>
	<li>Normal conversations</li>
	<li>Phones on vibrate</li>
</ul>
<strong>Second Floor:</strong>

Noise Level: 65 Decibels and above
Examples of 65 dB:
<ul>
	<li>Dolphin echolocation</li>
	<li>Your average day in the rainforest</li>
	<li>The sound of productivity and engagement</li>
	<li>Normal conversations</li>
	<li>Phones on vibrate</li>
</ul>
<strong>Third Floor: </strong>

Noise Level: 30-45 decibels
Examples of 30-45 dB:
<ul>
	<li>Rustling leaves</li>
	<li>A babbling brook</li>
	<li>Nighttime in the desert</li>
	<li>Whispered conversations</li>
	<li>Phones on vibrate; no talking on the phone or Skyping</li>
</ul>
<strong>Fourth Floor: </strong>

Noise Level: Under 30 decibels
Examples of under 30 dB:
<ul>
	<li>Breathing</li>
	<li>The Hum of a light bulb</li>
	<li>A pin dropping</li>
	<li>The turning of book pages</li>
	<li>Footsteps</li>
	<li>Phone on silent, no taking on the phone or Skyping</li>
</ul>

So from now on, every time you come to Snell you can pick which space will work best for your needs.  Make Snell your own!
