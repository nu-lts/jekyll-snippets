Hello Huskies!

My name is Kristina Lopez, I am a third year criminal justice major and history minor. I am also the Vice President for Academic Affairs in the Student Government Association, and I am honored to be a guest blogger for Club Snell!

I have spent countless hours in the library working on different projects and assignments, and I look forward to giving both a student perspective as well as the perspective of someone who works closely with the library to see through all the exciting changes that happen there!

I am always available for comments or questions; you can email me at <a href="mailto:lopez.k@husky.neu.edu">lopez.k@husky.neu.edu</a> or stop by the SGA office in 332 Curry!
