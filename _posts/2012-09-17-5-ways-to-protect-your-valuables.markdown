Every week you read that student laptops and backpacks disappear from campus lounges, labs, and, of course, even Snell Library. While no method is foolproof in preventing theft, here are some things you can do to reduce the likelihood that your valuables will be stolen:

**1. Purchase and carry a laptop lock.**  It's true that a determined thief can use boltcutters or other strategies to thwart a lock, but locks do prevent opportunistic theft by someone walking by and looking for an easy target.  Lock your laptop to anchors on our tables and desks, or to anything secure.  You can find more information about laptop locks at [SecureNU](http://www.northeastern.edu/securenu/?page_id=1508).

**2. Borrow a laptop lock.** We have locks you can borrow at the Circulation Desk on the first floor of Snell Library. Be aware that they may not work with every device (Macbook Air, I'm looking at you!)--which is why buying your own lock may be a better choice.

**3. Don't bring your laptop!** We have laptops, ipads, cameras and graphic tablets that you can borrow (along with a lock, by the way!) or just use one of the hundreds of Mac and PC computers on every floor of Snell Library and in the Infocommons.

**4. Don't leave anything unattended**. It sounds obvious, but it's so tempting to think, "I'm sure it's OK to leave my stuff for a couple of secs and run over to Argo Tea or the restroom."  Don't do it--sadly, that's when most thefts happen. Take your valuables with you.

**5. Use your judgment and don't rely on others.** If you tell a stranger to watch your stuff, both the stuff and the stranger may be gone when you return!

If you notice anything missing, please report it immediately to the Circulation Desk on the first floor.  We can check our lost and found and help you to follow up with Campus Security if needed.
