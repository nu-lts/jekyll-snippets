In just a few weeks, we'll be celebrating the sixth annual international Open Access Week, held this year October 22-26, 2012. As in [previous](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=2509) [years](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=4184), we're planning events and displays that will highlight the importance of sharing information freely, without restrictions like subscription costs.

#### What is Open Access?




> "Open Access to information – the free, immediate, online access to the results of scholarly research, and the right to use and re-use those results as you need – has the power to transform the way research and scientific inquiry are conducted. It has direct and widespread implications for academia, medicine, science, industry, and for society as a whole.

Open Access (OA) has the potential to maximize research investments, increase the exposure and use of published research, facilitate the ability to conduct research across available literature, and enhance the overall advancement of scholarship. Research funding agencies, academic institutions, researchers and scientists, teachers, students, and members of the general public are supporting a move towards Open Access in increasing numbers every year."
