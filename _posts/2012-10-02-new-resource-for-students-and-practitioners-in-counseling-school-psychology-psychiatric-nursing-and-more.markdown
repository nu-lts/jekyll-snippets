[Counseling and Therapy in Video Volume 1](http://library.northeastern.edu/find/resources/items/counseling-and-therapy-in-video-alexander-street)  from Alexander Street Press (current NU only) is now available.

This valuable resource includes over 400 hours of training videos, reenactments, and real-life therapy sessions. Counseling and Therapy in Video Volume 1 is a great tool for counselors-in-training, as it allows one to observe, in face-to-face sessions, subtleties of body language, facial expressions, behavior, speech patterns and intonation.

Some of the perks: every video includes a synchronized transcript. Users can create, edit, and share playlists or clips. Videos are searchable by keywords and subjects, and arranged by easy-to-browse topical subject areas and therapeutic methods.

For example, you could search for Gestalt, Solution Focused, or Family Therapy sessions. You could search for clips where a client diagnosed with depression uses the word drink.  Or you could compare and contrast how cognitive-behavioral therapists and client-centered therapists treat a similar condition.

You can browse all titles or search by subject or therapy type.

This resource is listed on the [A-Z Index (under the FIND menu)](http://library.northeastern.edu/find/resources/a-to-z-index) and on [my psychology subject guide](http://subjectguides.lib.neu.edu/psychology). The subject guide includes my contact information-- I am interested to hear your comments and questions about this new acquisition.
