This week is the sixth International Open Access Week – a global event highlighting the importance of open access to information. We’re offering four events this week that focus on different aspects of Open Access.

Today’s event is a webcast cosponsored by SPARC and the World Bank – it’s a 90-minute panel and Q&amp;A moderated by Heather Joseph, the Executive Director of SPARC. The World Bank recently was named a SPARC Innovator for its open access policy and launch of an open data repository. The panelists are:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Michael Carroll</strong>, <em>Professor of Law, American University and founding Board Member, Creative Commons</em></li>
	<li><strong>Matt Cooper</strong>, <em>President, The National Association of Graduate-Professional Students </em></li>
	<li><strong>Maricel Kann</strong>, <em>Assistant Professor, University of Maryland and member, PubMed Central National Advisory Committee, NIH.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Carlos Rossel</strong>, <em>Publisher, The World Bank</em></li>
	<li><strong>Neil Thakur</strong>, <em>Special Assistant to the Deputy Director, Extramural Research, National Institutes of Health (NIH)</em></li>
</ul>
We’ll be streaming the webcast in the <strong>DMC AV Circle #1</strong> (the one with the puzzle-piece wall); refreshments will be served. It’s a 90-minute event, from <strong>4:00-5:30 pm</strong>.

You’ll also see a table set up in the lobby all week at lunchtime (11:30-1:30), staffed by me and some of our liaison librarians – stop by for lots of information about Open Access and free giveaways! Information about the full week is on our website at <a href="http://library.northeastern.edu/openaccess">http://library.northeastern.edu/openaccess</a>.
