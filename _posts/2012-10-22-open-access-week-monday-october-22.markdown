This week is the sixth International Open Access Week – a global event highlighting the importance of open access to information. We’re offering four events this week that focus on different aspects of Open Access.

Today’s event is a webcast cosponsored by SPARC and the World Bank – it’s a 90-minute panel and Q&A moderated by Heather Joseph, the Executive Director of SPARC. The World Bank recently was named a SPARC Innovator for its open access policy and launch of an open data repository. The panelists are:



	
  * **Michael Carroll**, _Professor of Law, American University and founding Board Member, Creative Commons_

	
  * **Matt Cooper**, _President, The National Association of Graduate-Professional Students _

	
  * **Maricel Kann**, _Assistant Professor, University of Maryland and member, PubMed Central National Advisory Committee, NIH._

	
  * **Carlos Rossel**, _Publisher, The World Bank_

	
  * **Neil Thakur**, _Special Assistant to the Deputy Director, Extramural Research, National Institutes of Health (NIH)_


We’ll be streaming the webcast in the **DMC AV Circle #1** (the one with the puzzle-piece wall); refreshments will be served. It’s a 90-minute event, from **4:00-5:30 pm**.

You’ll also see a table set up in the lobby all week at lunchtime (11:30-1:30), staffed by me and some of our liaison librarians – stop by for lots of information about Open Access and free giveaways! Information about the full week is on our website at [http://library.northeastern.edu/openaccess](http://library.northeastern.edu/openaccess).
