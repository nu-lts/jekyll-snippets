Today's Open Access Week event is a webcast of a talk at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard: "How to Make Your Research Open Access (Whether You're at Harvard or Not)." The speakers are well-known in the world of open access – Peter Suber and Stuart Shieber of the Harvard Open Access Project, the Berkman Center community, and the Harvard Office for Scholarly Communication . They'll be discussing the Harvard Open Access policies and presenting concrete steps for how authors can make their work Open Access wherever they may be.

We'll be streaming the webcast in the DMC AV Circle 1 (the one with the matrix wall), from 12:30-1:30 – feel free to bring your lunch, we'll be serving cookies and beverages!
