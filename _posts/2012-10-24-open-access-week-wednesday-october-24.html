Today’s Open Access Week event is an opportunity to hear from representatives of Open Access journals. We’ll have speakers here from <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.org">BioMedCentral</a> and <a href="http://sgo.sagepub.com">SAGE Open</a>, and I will be providing information on the <a href="http://www.plos.org">Public Library of Science (PLoS)</a>. This will be an excellent opportunity for researchers on campus to learn more about Open Access journals and gain a better understanding of how they compare to traditional, subscription-based journals.

The event is at noon in 90 Snell Library – pizza will be served!
