Today’s Open Access Week event is an opportunity to hear from representatives of Open Access journals. We’ll have speakers here from [BioMedCentral](http://www.biomedcentral.org) and [SAGE Open](http://sgo.sagepub.com), and I will be providing information on the [Public Library of Science (PLoS)](http://www.plos.org). This will be an excellent opportunity for researchers on campus to learn more about Open Access journals and gain a better understanding of how they compare to traditional, subscription-based journals.

The event is at noon in 90 Snell Library – pizza will be served!
