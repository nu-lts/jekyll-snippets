Visit the <a title="Roper Center, University of Connecticut" href="http://0-www.ropercenter.uconn.edu.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/" target="_blank">Roper Center Public Opinion Archives</a> to immerse yourself in Presidential approval ratings, state and national exit polls, or facts and figures on Presidential elections from 1976 through 2008. For the more adventurous researcher, Roper’s <a title="iPoll" href="http://0-webapps.ropercenter.uconn.edu.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/CFIDE/cf/action/ipoll/" target="_blank">iPoll</a> database provides access to poll questions and survey data collected from the 1930’s to present.  Track public opinion on the trustworthiness of the President, Congress, and individual candidates from the late 1980’s onward.  Check a recent Bloomberg poll to learn which Presidential candidate is considered best qualified to handle relations with Middle Eastern countries in the aftermath of the Benghazi consulate incident.

<a title="Polling the Nations" href="http://0-poll.orspub.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/" target="_blank">Polling the Nations</a> includes polls conducted abroad and in the U.S.  You’ll learn how respondents in selected countries feel about President Obama’s foreign policy decisions.  Check a Pew Research Center poll to see how world leaders, including President Obama, are rated by citizens from a variety of nations.

<a title="Vital Statistics on American Politics" href="http://0-library.cqpress.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/vsap?PHPSESSID=nlba56gnctbc4guedp1s1oitd3" target="_blank">Vital Statistics on American Politics</a> offers statistics on campaign finance, media outlets and politics, voter turnout, and mid-term elections among other topics.

For background on elections and political parties worldwide, check the newly acquired <a title="International Encyclopedia of Political Science" href="http://0-knowledge.sagepub.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/view/intlpoliticalscience/SAGE.xml?rskey=I0kH6i&amp;row=1" target="_blank">International Encyclopedia of Political Science</a>.  Articles on political parties, electoral geography, and electoral campaigns provide background on these topics in both the U.S. and other countries.

To see photos from Presidential debates, past and present, visit our <a title="AP Images" href="http://0-apimages.ap.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/unsecured/logip.aspx" target="_blank">AP Images</a> database. Classic photos from the 1960 Nixon/Kennedy debates make an interesting contrast with the current Obama/Romney debate images.  For starters, only one of the Nixon/Kennedy images is in color!   Debate moderators from the sixties are identified in photo captions only; today, they’re celebrities in their own rights with photos included with those of the candidates.
