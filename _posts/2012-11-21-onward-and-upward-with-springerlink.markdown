[![](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/srook.jpg)](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/srook.jpg)It's 6am on a cold November morning, and I know I'm not the only one awake.  As I am writing this, a few Northeastern researchers are online with me, and are currently reading:

*A book chapter about the semantic web
*An article about arterial fibrillation
*An article about human trafficking

How do I know this?  Because Springer, the venerable German publisher of chiefly scientific research, has recently updated its SpringerLink web site.

The content on the new site is the same solid high-quality research they've always had, searchable and easily linkable, with full text PDFs available DRM-free, even for ebook chapters, to NU affiliates.

But the new site has this "Recent Activity" feature.  It's anonymous, but anyone, including you, can see a little window into what's being read on SpringerLink at Northeastern right now.  More importantly, the new SpringerLink site has a cleaned-up layout and style that displays better in a variety of browsers.  The search results page now shows results at the individual book chapter level, with a "look inside" feature for content not licensed by our library that you may want to purchase.  The "advanced search" has been revamped and is easier to use.

**We do have a warning about the new site:** If you've been a "power user" of Springer Link in the past, you may have set up a "My Account" feature to save your searches, tag your results, and keep a history of any personal orders. _Please be aware that your "My Account" on the old SpringerLink will NOT be migrated to the new site._ (Unfortunately Springer claims that privacy rules prohibit them from notifying account-holders individually.) You'll have to set up a new account on the new site and start all over.  The new "My Account" also allows you to log in from anywhere, not just through the NU Libraries.

Currently both the old and the new Springer Link sites are available, so "My Account" users should log in over the Thanksgiving break and save what's in your old account. Beginning sometime Monday morning, 11/26, you'll be redirected to the new site and the old site and old account information will no longer be available.

So [give the new Springer Link a test drive](http://0-link.springer.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu). Have fun seeing the "Recent Activity" of researchers at NU. I just checked, and it's now a book about genetically modified plants and an article about Harry Potter from an education journal. I'm sure when you log in it will be something completely different!
