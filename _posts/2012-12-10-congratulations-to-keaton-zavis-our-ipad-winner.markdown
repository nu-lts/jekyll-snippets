In addition to ten lucky winners of Dunkin Donuts gift cards, we raffled a new iPad which was won by Keaton Zavis, shown at left today receiving his iPad from Dean of University Libraries Will Wakeling.

Congratulations to all our winners, and to all of the over 100 people who took the time to participate in the survey, we'll be sure to publish the results on this blog. Your feedback will help us make Snell even better in the new year!
