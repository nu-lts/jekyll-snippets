Town Hall meetings are one of the best forums for a no-pressure open and honest discussion between the Northeastern administration and the student body. This week’s Snell Library Town Hall was no exception! The turnout was great and the discussion even better.

Topics ranged from how comfortable the chairs are to the possibility of sound-proofing spaces, no topic was off limits.

With a panel featuring Will Wakeling, the Dean of Libraries; Rehan Kahn, Vice President of Information Services; and Jim Cahill, Vice President of Facilities, answers were informative and the feedback truly taken into advisement. It really was a successful event that went off without a hitch. Be sure to keep an eye out for a full length article in Northeastern News, and we'll keep you posted about the next meeting so you can join us next time!
