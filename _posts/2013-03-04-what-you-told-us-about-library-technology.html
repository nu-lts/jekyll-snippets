Thanks to all of you who participated in the Library Technology Survey at the end of the fall semester, we have a wealth of data about what technology you are using in the library and what you appreciate most about our technology offerings.

We conducted the survey over three days, two days in the lobby of Snell Library, one day on the second floor.  You may remember the tables and laptops we set up beside bowls of grapes and candy to entice you, or you may remember that we offered an iPad in a drawing for participants to enter (<a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=5569">congratulations Keaton</a>!).

Here are some highlights of our survey results:

First of all, we learned that over 84% of students who responded to the survey said you <strong>carry a laptop</strong> "always" or "sometimes" when you visit the library.  Not surprising that 63.5% of you said when you come to Snell, you're looking for "a quiet place to plug in my laptop".

When it comes to desktops, those of you who do carry a laptop were more likely to say Snell Library has "just about the right number of computers."

When it comes to work spaces, we were really interested to hear how you feel about the different spaces and furniture in the second floor Digital Media Commons.  <strong>The most popular space</strong> in the Commons are the group study rooms, with second place a tie between dual monitor Mac workstations, and large screen monitors for connecting to your own laptop.

We also asked about your <strong>favorite operating system</strong>.  In the Infocommons, the ratio of Windows to MacOS users is 60:40.  In the Digital Media Commons, Apple ekes out a victory at 52:48.  In both environments, <strong>the most popular software is web browsers, and Microsoft Office products</strong>: Word, Excel, Powerpoint.  We made a point of asking about the use of video and graphics software, in both cases, the amount of use was small but we expect it to increase over time.

One of the questions we asked had to do with <strong>printing</strong>: where on campus would you like to see additional printing?  We left this question open-ended, and 12% of you said "all buildings" ! Curry Student Center was another popular suggestion, and as you know by now, that is done!  The remaining suggestions grouped themselves along a few lines:  23% of you identified buildings in the Centennial Commons/West Village area, 14% said there should be printers for students in all academic/classroom buildings, 13% identified dorms.   We've passed this information along to Northeastern University Information Services.

The survey also helped us identify some of your most important <strong>new technology needs</strong>, for example, Thunderbolt monitors and touch screen/Windows 8 support.   Thanks for those suggestions, and we'll try to address them going forward.

<strong>We also identified a conundrum</strong>: some of you noticed that your peers are coming to the library to work and study at a large table.  When tables run out, they may use a computer desk in the Digital Media Commons for studying, even though they aren't using the actual computer at all--meanwhile, that computer is now no longer available to those who need it.  Any suggestions on how to solve that one?  Feel free to comment and let us know!
