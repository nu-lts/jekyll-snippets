<a href="http://wellcomelibrary.org/using-the-library/subject-guides/genetics/makers-of-modern-genetics" target="_blank">Codebreakers:  Makers of Modern Genetics</a> is a newly-launched treasure trove for fans of science, history, and of course, the history of science!

The Wellcome Library has digitized the papers of key players in genetics from the last century and made them freely available online. Works of <a href="http://wellcomelibrary.org/using-the-library/subject-guides/genetics/makers-of-modern-genetics/digitised-archives/francis-crick/" target="_blank">Crick</a>, <a href="http://wellcomelibrary.org/using-the-library/subject-guides/genetics/makers-of-modern-genetics/digitised-archives/james-watson/" target="_blank">Watson</a>, <a href="http://wellcomelibrary.org/using-the-library/subject-guides/genetics/makers-of-modern-genetics/digitised-archives/rosalind-franklin/" target="_blank">Franklin</a>, <a href="http://wellcomelibrary.org/using-the-library/subject-guides/genetics/makers-of-modern-genetics/digitised-archives/maurice-wilkins-mrc-biophysics-unit-archive/" target="_blank">Wilkins</a>, and <a href="http://wellcomelibrary.org/using-the-library/subject-guides/genetics/makers-of-modern-genetics/digitised-archives/j-b-s-haldane/" target="_blank">Haldane</a> are all represented, to name a few. The papers include lab notebooks, sketches, articles, drafts and general correspondence. The site also contains items from the <a href="http://wellcomelibrary.org/using-the-library/subject-guides/genetics/makers-of-modern-genetics/digitised-archives/eugenics-society/" target="_blank">archive of the Eugenics Society</a>, including the heredity chart shown above. In addition to these digitized artifacts, the site features digitized books and a great interactive timeline on the history of genetics.
