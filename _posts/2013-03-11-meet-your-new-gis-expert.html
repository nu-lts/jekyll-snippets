[caption id="attachment_5771" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Kevan Grimaldi "]<img class="size-medium wp-image-5771 " title="Kevan Grimaldi" src="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/kevan-300x200.jpg" alt="Kevan Grimaldi" width="300" height="200" />[/caption]

College of Professional Studies graduate Kevan Grimaldi has returned to Northeastern as a new GIS assistant. She followed a lifelong interest in maps and geoscience into an undergraduate program in Earth science at Dartmouth College, where she got her first taste of geographic information systems (GIS). After finishing at Dartmouth, she became a full-time GIS user for a private navigations company, and later entered Northeastern's own masters program in geographic information technology.

Kevan's new role at Snell will be to support faculty, staff, and students in their respective GIS-based endeavors. She plans to offer both one-on-one consultations for specific projects and workshops and training on general GIS use, and will be available by email and appointment. Ask at the Digital Media Commons Information desk on the second floor of Snell to get connected with Kevan.

When not immersing herself in geospatial data, Kevan enjoys orienteering, reading, and various pursuits through involvement in the <a title="SCA" href="http://www.sca.org/" target="_blank">Society for Creative Anachronism</a>, including calligraphy and illumination, archery, and homebrewing. She looks forward to meeting and working with her fellow Huskies on their geospatial projects. Welcome, Kevan!
