Remember the <a title="Global Game Jam" href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=5707" target="_blank">Global Game Jam hosted at the DMC</a> in January? All the great games that participants created in just 48 hours? Well, you can now play six of the games here in the library. <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/games/astrophage/">Astrophage</a>, <a title="Jarheart" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=0NZrOPZz_Zw" target="_blank">Jarheart</a>, <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/games/vahiy/">Vahiy</a>, <a title="The Witching Meow-er" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=TQQu4lmD_P8" target="_blank">The Witching Meow-er</a>, <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/games/lost-hearts/">Lost Hearts</a>, and <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/games/heart-of-the-mountain/">Heart of the Mountain</a> have been loaded onto a desktop computer in the Hub on the first floor. So stop by and try out the games yourself- they’re pretty fun!
