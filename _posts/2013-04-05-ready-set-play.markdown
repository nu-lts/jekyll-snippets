Remember the [Global Game Jam hosted at the DMC](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/?p=5707) in January? All the great games that participants created in just 48 hours? Well, you can now play six of the games here in the library. [Astrophage](http://www.northeastern.edu/games/astrophage/), [Jarheart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=0NZrOPZz_Zw), [Vahiy](http://www.northeastern.edu/games/vahiy/), [The Witching Meow-er](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=TQQu4lmD_P8), [Lost Hearts](http://www.northeastern.edu/games/lost-hearts/), and [Heart of the Mountain](http://www.northeastern.edu/games/heart-of-the-mountain/) have been loaded onto a desktop computer in the Hub on the first floor. So stop by and try out the games yourself- they’re pretty fun!
