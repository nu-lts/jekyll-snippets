“ …Lies, damned lies, and statistics.”  So the saying goes.   But used carefully, statistics can be powerful allies in backing up an assertion or strengthening an argument.   With that in mind, the library’s social sciences team has created a Guide to Social Science Statistics.  The guide points the way  to facts and figures collected by government, commercial and private entities arranged under topics such as demographics, health, business/ economics, education, sports, energy/environment and more.  The guide strives to include all major sources of statistical information, but if you don’t find the number you are looking for, ask a librarian.
