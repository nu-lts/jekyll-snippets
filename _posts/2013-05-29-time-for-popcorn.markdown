![The Microwaves](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_6538-300x200.jpg)















Drumroll please!

We’ve brought the microwaves back in response to your feedback through surveys and the Town Hall Meeting last semester! Thanks for all your feedback--we appreciate it.

They’re temporarily located on the second floor behind the printer room. Please be respectful of others and make sure to keep the area clean.

Enjoy!
