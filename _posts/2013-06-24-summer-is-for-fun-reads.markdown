It finally feels like summer, with the temperature hitting 90 degrees this week! We’ve collected a few books for a refreshing summer reading lineup, recommended by our own Snell Library staff. Hint: They'd be great for reading at the beach or in an air-conditioned coffee shop.

[Bring up the Bodies](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu/record=b2690897), by Hilary Mantel

"A distinguished, unforgettable novel.  History's bad characters are turned good and virtual saints become flawed.  The author's prose and metaphors are worthy of the better writers of the 16th century and, most remarkable of all, she successfully weaves her narrative in the present tense." -_James Dendy_



[![Death and the Penguin](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Death-and-the-Penguin-Cover-203x300.jpg)](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Death-and-the-Penguin-Cover.jpeg)Death and the Penguin, by Andrey Kurkov

"I highly recommend this crime novel about a man who writes obituaries for the local newspaper, finds himself in some deep trouble, and also happens to keep a penguin as a pet." -_Sarah Sweeney_





[![Gone Girl](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/8442457-197x300.jpg)](http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/8442457.jpg)[Gone Girl](http://nucat.lib.neu.edu:80/record=b2724898~S19), by Gillian Flynn

"This compelling suspense novel about a completely dysfunctional marriage was very engaging and a quick read. The characters were fascinating and I enjoyed the back-and-forth telling of the story by the husband and wife." -_Rebecca Bailey_





What are you reading this summer? Any recommendations for us?
