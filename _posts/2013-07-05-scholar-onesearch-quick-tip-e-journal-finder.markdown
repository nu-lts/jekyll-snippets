Now that [Scholar OneSearch](http://onesearch.northeastern.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?vid=NU) is live, we want to help you get the most out of this research tool!  This is our first installment in a series of Scholar OneSearch Quick Tips. Today's tip: **accessing and using the e-journal finder.**

You can access the list of all our e-journals through the **E-journal A-Z** link at the top right of the Scholar OneSearch page.

Once you're on the E-journal A-Z page, if you'd like to limit to a specific journal title or a research area, you can enter terms into the search box (as I did for "secondary education" here):

More details on each title are available under the tabs. For example, you can view our holdings information for any of those journals by clicking the 'view online' tab:
