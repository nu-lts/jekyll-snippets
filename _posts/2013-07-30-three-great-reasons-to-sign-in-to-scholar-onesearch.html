You've tried the new search box on the library web page and it seems just fine. But did you know that you can get even more out of it when you sign in?

If you're a current NU student, faculty, or staff member, here are 4 great reasons to <a href="http://library.northeastern.edu/myaccount">sign in to Scholar OneSearch</a> every time you use it:

<strong>1. If you sign in, you get more high-quality search results.</strong> This is because the NU Libraries subscribe to some great scholarly content that will display ONLY if you show you're affiliated with the university. Web of Science (the Thomson Reuters citation indexes), ArtSTOR, GeoRef (American Geological Institute), and MLA Bibliography (Modern Language Association) have key scholarly citations that you will only see if you sign in with your myNEU credentials.

<strong>2. If you sign in, you can make requests. </strong>Some full text and book requesting options are only available to NU affiliates. Signing in lets you see all the options available to you.

<strong>3. If you sign in, you can save your work.</strong> Whether it's individual citations, or whole batches of results, you can make folders for different projects, and even save searches to update and run again at a later date. Instead of having to remember another password, this service is based on the same credentials you use for myNEU.

<strong>4. If you sign in, you can see your account information.</strong> You can view and renew the items you have checked out from the library, and see the requests you have made and waiting lists you are on.

<strong>And here's another tip:</strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/myNEULink.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-6021 aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.lib.neu.edu/snippets/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/myNEULink.png" alt="" width="391" height="500" /></a></p>
Think about connecting directly to Scholar OneSearch the next time you're in <a href="http://myneu.neu.edu">myNEU</a>. Just go to the "Services and Links" tab in myNEU (or use the library tab, if you're a faculty/staff member), and look under "Useful Links". Because Scholar OneSearch recognizes your NU identity, you will automatically be signed in.

Give it a try, and let us know if you think it's worthwhile!
