Now that Scholar OneSearch is live, we want to help you get the most out of this research tool!  This is our next installment in a series of Scholar OneSearch Quick Tips. Today’s tip: **searching the library catalog**.




The default option in Scholar OneSearch lets you search beyond Northeastern University Library holdings and includes articles from a variety of journals, because the tool is meant to help people quickly discover all kinds of information in different formats. This is the “Library Catalogs + Articles” choice that is already selected when you first start to search.
